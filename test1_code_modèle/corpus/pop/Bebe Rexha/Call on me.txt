Under the moonlight, caressin' me right
God only knows how long I've waited for this
It's been the longest time


You never made me feel like heaven
Never made me feel this high


If I need a lover
Someone to hold me
Satisfy all my needs
If I need a lover
Someone to save me
Someone to set me free
I call on me

I call on me
If I need a lover
I call on me


Out here alone just like a burnin' flame
I hear the wind, it's whisperin' my name
God only knows how long I've waited for this
I've lived a million lives


You never made me feel like heaven
Never made me feel this high


If I need a lover
Someone to hold me
Satisfy all my needs
If I need a lover
Someone to save me
Someone to set me free
I call on me


I call on me
If I need a lover
I call on me
You might also like
'Cause you never made me feel like heaven
Never made me feel this high


If I need a lover
Someone to hold me
Satisfy all my needs
If I need a lover
Someone to save me
Someone to set me free
I call on me


I call on me
If I need a lover
I call on me
