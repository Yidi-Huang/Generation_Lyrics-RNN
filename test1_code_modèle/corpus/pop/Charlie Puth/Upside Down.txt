Yeah
Down south, hood baby (Hood baby)
Ooh, yeah
Make all the girls (Ah)
Go crazy
Go (Go)
Go (Go)
Go stupid
But you smart like an A-plus student


Up, down, right, down
Looking for your love right now
La-la-la-la
Up, down, all around
Turn my stomach upside down
La-la-la-la


I found your hair-tie in my car
I could only drive so far without a breakdown (Ah)
Baby, you’re the queen of hearts
You know how to play your cards, you keep ‘em face-down (Ah-ooh)
Ooh, I miss your face now (Now)
Lookin’ at your pictures, scrollin’ way down (Down)
Wishing I could fix all my mistakes (Mistakes)
I wish I could erase you
Girl, I can’t replace
You’re the one that got away (Ooh)
You might also like
Girl, your energy
Feels so heavenly
Make me feel like
La-la-la-la
You a melody (You a melody)
Put to memory (Put to memory)
It goes something like
La-la-la-la
