I just want you to feel
I just want you to feel
You got somebody


Some people got a problem with monogamy
I never cheated, yeah, my mama, she's so proud of me (Look out)
But my relationship is tested constantly
And yes, I guess


These pretty girls, they tryna get me confused
Though I get cravings, they got nothing on you
Damn, it's so tempting, but I leave on my own
My heart is hungry, but I eat home


I just want you to feel un-jealous, love
I just want you to feel unselfish, love
Come put that sexy thing on top of me and between us
I just want you to feel, I just want you to feel
You got somebody


I know some people struggling with honesty
Sometimes it feels like we're working against biology
I love to love and to make love just comes so easily
And yes, I'm blessed
You might also like
These pretty girls, they tryna get me confused
Though I get cravings, they got nothing on you
Damn, it's so tempting, but I leave on my own
My heart is hungry, but I eat home


I just want you to feel un-jealous, love (Woo)
I just want you to feel unselfish, love
Come put that sexy thing on top of me and between us
I just want you to feel, I just want you to feel
You got somebody


Don't be jealous, love, you got somebody
You're the one I want, come put that sexy on me
Don't be jealous, love, you got somebody
You're the one I want


Everybody makes mistakes
And I never said I was perfect
For you, I'd go out of my way
'Cause you are so incomparable, babe
In every sensational way
Nobody, nobody does it like you

I just want you to feel un-jealous, love (Un-jealous, love)
I just want you to feel unselfish, love
Come put that sexy thing on top of me and between us
I just want you to feel, I just want you to feel
You got somebody


Don't be jealous, love, you got somebody
You're the one I want, come put that sexy on me
Don't be jealous, love, you got somebody
You're the one I want, come put that sexy on meEmbed
