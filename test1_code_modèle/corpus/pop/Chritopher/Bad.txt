Finally you found yourself a friend, and you run him over
Ever since the start, I saw the end around the corner
'Cause I know you so well


So predictable
You're an animal
I can't let you go
You're so good at being bad, you know

You know I'm not gonna leave your side, and I can't deny it
Tried to play it cool but I can't hide my true desire
'Cause I can see the dirty in your eyes, my favourite liar
And I know you so well, well, well, well
