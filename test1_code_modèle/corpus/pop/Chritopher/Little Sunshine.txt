Little sunshine on the street
I see her footprints in the snow
Mmh I used to drag my feet
Now I know which way to go


It's been a year now, I can't wait
Only one month love a fair
To see your pretty face
I missed you so much and I swear


Ohh If I could keep you here,  I would
Cause we both know we can't stop
I've been thinking about you for 11 months now
I can't let you go like this  time, knowing that you're not mine
And then miss you for 11 months again
Oh-oh yeaah


Little sunshine on the street
I'm smiling at you till you blush
There should be more days like these
My one and only Christmas crush
You might also like
And I won't let you go back
I've said that every year
And we're both not fine with that
Just let me make this clear


Ohh If I could keep you here,  I would
Cause we both know we can't stop
I've been thinking about you for 11 months now
I can't let you go like this time, knowing that you're not mine
And then miss you for 11 months again
Oh-oh yeaah


Now baby, look at me, tell me what you see
We both know you're gonna leave
So let's make the best of the time we have
Cause we'll never get it back
I wanna see you smile, baby, don't you cry
Mmh Let's remember tonight
Maybe it's the last one we ever have
And we might never get it back


If I could keep you here, I would
Cause we both know we   can't stop
I've been thinking about you for 11 months now
I can't let you go like this time, knowing that you're not mine
And then miss you for 11 months again
Oh-oh yeaahEmbed
