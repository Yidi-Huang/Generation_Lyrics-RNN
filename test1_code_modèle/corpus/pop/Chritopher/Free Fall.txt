We're standing on the edge of mystery
If you jump and I jump
That's the only way to set us free fall
Each jump in one to free fall


Baby, this is where
Baby, this is where you run away
Baby, this is where you wanna be
Baby, this is where you run away, run away

How can two people
Fall in love at the same time?
Acting like it's not possible
We're both in denial
When you see the leaves falling
Baby know that you can lean on me
I can't promise anything
You just gotta trust me, baby


You know and I know
We're standing on the edge of mystery
If you jump and I jump
That's the only way to set us free fall
Is jumping on to free fall


Baby, this is where
Baby, this is where you run away
Baby, this is where you wanna be
Baby, this is where you run away, run away


You don't know what's out there, out there
But we gotta go
You don't have to be scared, be scared
To be on your own
When you see the leaves falling
Baby know that you can lean on me
I can't promise anything
You just gotta trust me, baby
You might also like
You know and I know
We're standing on the edge of mystery
If you jump and I jump
That's the only way to set us free fall
Each jump in one to free fall


Baby, this is where
Baby, this is where you run away
Baby, this is where you wanna be
Baby, this is where you run away, run awayEmbed
