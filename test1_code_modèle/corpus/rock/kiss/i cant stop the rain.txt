Night falls on the city
Finds me all alone
Makes me wonder
Should I just go on home?

And I walk up the stairs
To see if you're sill there
Would you mind if
I found you alone?

Then a cold wind came callin'
Strange how it knew me by my name

See the night would fade
But the pain's gonna stay
Makes me wonder
How you ever made love to me

I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
Lightnin' strikes across the sky
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
Lightnin' only blinds my eyes
You might also likeAin't it sad
When the only love I ever had
Just slips away
Right through my fingers

Ain't it a shame
When I think of your name
The only memory I have is pain

I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
Lightnin' strikes across the sky
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
It takes a witch to curse that goddamn sky

I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
Lightnin' strikes across the sky
Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes

Oh, I can't stop the rain, here it comes again
'Cause lightnin' only blinds my eyes

Can't stop itEmbed
