Could you feel your life slipping away?
I pulled out my gun, I had nowhere to run

So I shot you in the face
But you didn't fall down

Your eyes shine with a eerie light
I've seen the light of purest evil
An undead rock and roll machine
Once idolized by millions
Your corpse grows cold beneath the rain
And baby I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
How'd we ever turn out this way?

And I pray that someday you shall find
The kind of piece of mind enjoyed by Eddie from Iron Maiden
And I pray that someday you shall find
The kind of piece of mind enjoyed by Eddie from Iron Maiden

In a ritual to resurrect the dead
You need another life to trade
I couldn't say good-bye
I took a newborn's life
Long live the walking dead
Your zombie bite infects my flesh
I die to my own screams
But I didn't fall down

I've seen the light of purest evil
An undead rock and roll machine
Once idolized by millions
Your corpse grows cold beneath the rain
And baby I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry

And I pray that someday you shall find
The kind of piece of mind enjoyed by Eddie from Iron Maiden
