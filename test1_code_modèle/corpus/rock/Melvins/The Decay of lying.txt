There was still violence to behavior
There was a weakness to be sane
We had to go there just to get them
Out of the picture taking place


We were like heroes of the world
We died before we failed
There was no screaming
Only sleeping
To wear us down

Some things are never going to happen
Sometimes it's better if it stays
The times are tightening, that's the thinking
Sharpen ideas complicate
