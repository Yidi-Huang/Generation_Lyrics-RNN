Then it's all in time
And I won't let in almost sinnin'
Not a golden remain

I'll give her money and take a Run-A
(Beat it, beat it, beat it)
Mr. Bori! (come on, man)

Not allow those hither winner
Gonna sit right down
Didn't told you to take your ending
He said nothing, he said "I'm fine"
I'll give her money and take a Run-A
(Beat it, beat it, beat it)
Mr. Bori! (come on, man)You might also likeEmbed
