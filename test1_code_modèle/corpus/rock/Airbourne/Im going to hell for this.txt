On two legs
Like the wedding ring wrapped around her finger
I'm in the wrong bed
I feel myself slipping
Into hell's door
Like a hurricane, she's blowin' my brain
I'm coming back for more
Coz I know it's wrong
But it feels so right
I gotta take another bite

I'm Going To Hell
I'm Going To Hell For This
I'm Going To Hell
I'm Going To Hell For This

Satisfaction
Under my thumb
Yeah I tighten the knot, thicken the plot
Coz I'm in it for the fun
Coz I know it's so wrong
But it feels so right
I gotta take another bite

I'm Going To Hell
I'm Going To Hell For This
I'm Going To Hell
I'm Going To Hell For This
So get outta my way

He's got a gun
There's nowhere to run
Grab the kitchen knife
And I fight for my life

Coz I'm Going To Hell
Going To Hell For This
I'm Going To Hell
Going To Hell For This
I'm Going To Hell
Going To Hell For This
I'm Going To Hell
Going To Hell For ThisEmbed
