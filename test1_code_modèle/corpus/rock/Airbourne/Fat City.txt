I'm free from the chains
And all the dogs are running loose

I'm chasing my tail
And I'm losing my head
Yeah I'm falling down
I can't feel my legs
I'm on my way to a better place

Fat city
Juiced up and ready
Fat city
I'm already gone
Fat city
Juiced up and ready
Battered and bruised I keep a'rollin' on
Rollin' on

Saddle sore at the pony
From the black rockin' chair
I got what I need
I'm already there

I been riding so hard
Drank all the dregs
She's falling down
She can't feel her legs
We're on our way to a better place
