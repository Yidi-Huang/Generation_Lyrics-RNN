Looks like rain, looks like rain, looks like rain


Sittin' down in my crackhouse earnin' my pay
It's the Southwest Juggla claimin' Delray
Violent J, known by the gang squad and police alike
I'm known to get wrong off the get right
Hangin' at the truck I load a Mossberg off
Who the head of your set I blow your boss shirt off
I be the top dark killa, Who da bomb don
Ya soft like a bon-bon in ya Sean John
I'm ridin' dirtay, up and down Fort, escort
I'm in a Ringmaster gold Super Sport
And it's about to rain, I see the weather bad
Hit the top on up like I better had
I cut back to the cut to get a cut of my cut
'Cause even in a hurricane a crack head'll show up
I'll be the gang tag kayer, gay fag slayer
Bag weigher with a sweet street sweep A.K'er, I don't care

I like the darkness, it's 'bout to helly flow (It pours)
Tornado sirens, let it rain, wicked shit
I like the darkness, it's 'bout to helly flow (It pours)
Tornado sirens, let it rain, wicked shit


Its boring man, I'm smoking a blunt
Its pouring rain the hood soaking it up
But its gettin' kinda windy and the walls are shaking
Fuckin' roofs coming off, I'm in a La-Z-Boy bakin'
I see the crack heads tryna' reach the porch
But the wind sweep 'em off before they get to the door
They only ninety pounds, Grab something held down
'Cause you lookin' funny flying around, fag
Blunt wrap on my lap ash all over me
Playing Nintendo "Mega Man 4" from '93
Shutters are shaking and the lighting is frightening
Fuckin' windows are breaking, man I'm thinking it might be
A tornado, go to the door open it up
*Tornado noise* Yup
All the same back to my game it's all right
As long as that motherfucker stay outside I'm tight


I like the darkness, it's 'bout to helly flow (It pours)
Tornado sirens, let it rain, wicked shit
I like the darkness, it's 'bout to helly flow (It pours)

Holy fuckin' shit what the fuck is happelatin'?
The whole house spinning and shaking damn near breaking in half
I take it and laugh, 'cause what the fuck can I do?
I put the rocks in my sock so I don't lose them to
I'm fuckin hangin' out, I lost all but my drawers
Somehow my game still good chillin' on pause
We airborne and the windows flying
Passin' by are crack heads wavin' at me still tryna buy
Mailboxes, a pizza man, some garbage cans
Then I seen a naked ass bitch like, "Damn!"
There was all kinda crazy shit caught in the storm
But before long all the shit was gone *screams* *bang*Embed
