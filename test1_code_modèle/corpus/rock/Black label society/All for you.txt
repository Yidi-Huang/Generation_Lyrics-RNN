In the noose of life's rope
Through my loss of you
I have found no hope
Slain the emotions, lifeless and blue
Destroying myself now

All for you
All for you
All for you
Remote recollections of tranquility
Terror grotesquely becoming of me
Unnamable joy
When our blood once ran true
Destroying myself now

All for you
All you, all you, all you
All for you

All for you

All for you
All for youYou might also likeEmbed
