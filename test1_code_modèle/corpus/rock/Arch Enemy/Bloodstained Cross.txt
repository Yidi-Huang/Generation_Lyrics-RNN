Old times and lies you trust
In the end, there is no relief
A final breath, you're breathing dust




Get up off your praying knees
The door is about to slam shut
Armageddon, drawing near
As darkness engulfs your soul
All the prayers in this world
Won’t help you now

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross


A perverted truth, your reality
Forced your beliefs on the weak
Power twisted by years of abuse
The strong shall inherit the meek


Get up off your praying knees
The door is about to slam shut
Armageddon, drawing near
As darkness engulfs your soul
All the prayers in this world
Won’t help you now


You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You might also like


You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross


All the prayers in this world
Won't help you nowEmbed
