To be judged, to be shamed, no rights and no dignity
Beneath the eye of disdain
Where The Watcher sees the wicked, we compel


Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy Daughters of Death
Gripping the face of the Earth
Return to dirt
Under the Eye…


Don’t fear The Watcher - sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Bеware The Watcher - thе Earth is erased in Flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last


Does the Observer make reality?
Does the gaze activate quantum complicity?
Beneath the pyre and pain
Where we jettison body and brain!


Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy Daughters of Death
Gripping the face of the Earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye...

Beware The Watcher - the Earth is erased in Flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last
At last


Writhing with the Nephilim
Behold fire and flood!




Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy Daughters of Death
Gripping the face of the Earth
Return to dirt
Under the Eye…


Don’t fear The Watcher - sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware The Watcher - the Earth is erased in Flood
