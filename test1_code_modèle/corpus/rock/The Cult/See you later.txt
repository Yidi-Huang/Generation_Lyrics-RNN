Do you love me?
Yuh, hey
Yuh, hey


Wrist bloody, fuck life (Fuck)
Bitch fake, all lies (Aye)
I’ll just take that suicide (Fuck)
Stick ‘em razors in my eyes (Aye)
All these demons in my mind (Bitch)
Think they’re telling me a sign (Aye)
Possessed with Satan on the rise (Aye)
Cross me out with cracked up lines (What)


I’m in the cut like a razor
Gun in her mouth and it don’t even phase her
Blood on my wrist, I’ma save it for later
I gotta go, so I will see you later

In the cut, like a slut
She fuck me, and so what?
Jello shots, we fucked up
Where’s the coke?
Line it up
Bloody wrist, it’s fucked up
I can’t see shit boy
Niggas always on my dick
How the fuck you gettin’ lit?

You don't know anything
You won't help me, you won't even hold me
You're no one, no one, no one
Why won't you love me

Yeah, think I got a hold?
Next top model as my bottom hoe
Many many men wanna rob the role
If a pussy boy try, reaper rob his soul
Cook him like a crockpot time to go
No thought leave him knocked down, Domino (Bitch)
Leave him slopped on a cot
Momma on the line with 911, body at the hospital (Aye)
Why you tryna finesse?
Tryna rob the dope
Bragging ‘bout a couple bopper hoes
Shawty gave me top in the drop top
Popped it for a real one, you just another meal ticket
Why you getting hot?
Stop, drop, and roll
Where my pill sniffers in the function?
Know the drill with it, gettin’ dumb thot
She a real thizzler, trip, fall for me
Talking all that molly talk, fake love vibe killin’ and (Fuck)
Know I couldn't care, she got whatever type feeling
And know you pussy boys unwelcome under my ceiling (Aye)
Know you pussy boys unwelcome under my ceiling

Yeah, aye
