Will we slip? not (SLIPKNOT) ever, just tryna make hiphop better
Split money down the middle like a ziplock sweater
The game's gotten ill we're in search of THE CURE
Since Camron was rocking DEEP PURPLE velour, we've been
ROLLING STONES spitting verses on tour
Feel the RUSH from the crowd cause they worship the raw
On beats I drop gems, I've reached a spot in
Their Top-twenty but I'm tryna ZZ-TOP- ten
Life's a JOURNEY, we're looking for a way to expand
KISS my QUEEN on the day that I land
The 1210's Metallic, a (METALLICA) piece of art for A and his hands
My mic's diamond plated cut from iron made in (IRON MAIDEN) Japan
Sick of CHEAP TRICK producers all making trap beats
Who act deep but can only play THE BLACK KEYS
I'm getting tired like R.E.M. I'm half sleep
This the final countdown hit EUROPE and stack cheese, uh!


Just when the rap game has gotten old
And you've searched everywhere for that pot of gold
That's the moment we lock and load
Pro & Ak got the hot shit to rock your soul!

This is how we rock
Cause I know I got that soul
We won't stop rocking
Your inner soul
Rock your soul when I flow

Witness THE MIRACLES of ill spitters
BROTHERS BY CHOICE who still feel us
We maneuver like Grand Puba in his Hilfigures
I hear THE WHISPERS from these deal bidders
Who wanna eat of our plates but don't wanna split the bill with us
(BILL WITHERS)
INTRUDERS, I gotta hustle to eat
THE SUPREMES is a must on my feet, customized heat
A millie ain't jack son (MILLIE JACKSON) nothing is sweet
THE TEMPTATIONS we go through is rough in (RUFFIN) these streets
It's about THE IMPRESSIONS we make so I stay real
And always show courtesy (CURTIS) however I may feel (MAYFIELD)
Won't leave the game, P & A be the name
My DJ ROGERS every signal I make it's like we're the same
Spit that EARTH WIND & FIRE in the freezing rain
Can't keep THE EMOTIONS inside I gotta free the pain
(FREDA PAYNE)
So with the lead I write every night
And if your man said we're nice, you can bet he right!
(BETTY WRIGHT)
