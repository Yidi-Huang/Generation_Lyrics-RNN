As the Wehrmacht overrun, Russia 1941
They don't belong, we stand our ground, a million strong
We are ready for their strike, face the army of the Reich
A million strong, this is our land, they don't belong


Hear Marshal Zhukov's, and Stalin's orders
Defend the motherland, Moscow shall not fall!


Stand and follow command, our blood for the homeland
Heed the motherland's call, and brace for the storm
Moscow will never give in, there is no surrender
Force them into retreat, and into defeat


Facе the volleys of their guns, for Russia's daughtеrs and her sons
All the brave, who stand against the typhoon wave
From the mountains and the plains, come in thousands on the trains
Day and night, they're rolling in, to join the fight


From Kazakhstan to Magadan
Call of the motherland, Russia shall prevail!
