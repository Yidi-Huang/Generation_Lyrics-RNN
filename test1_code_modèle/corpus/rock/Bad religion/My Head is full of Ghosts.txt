Despite my residents'
Rivalry
And I'll be the faithful pilot on our blind trajectory


Do you wanna know a secret?
Will you hold it close and dear?
This'll not be made apparent
But you and I are not alone in here

My head is full of ghosts
No apparition
A partition from the host
A temple of cognition
And forbidden to approach


Oh to hell with superstition
There's a stranger in the house
I don't need no exorcism
I need
A key
And the lock is inside out



Now meta-cognition is just intuition
And dreamers will bark at the moon
The weaver's unknown by the loom


My head is full of ghosts
And I'm the pilot
Of ultra-violent ancestry
And I'll destroy these passers-by with zest and artistry

Ghost!
Part apparition
A partition from the host
A temple of the hidden
And unbidden to approachEmbed
