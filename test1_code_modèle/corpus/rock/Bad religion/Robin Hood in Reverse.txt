Wait what did he say?
What the fuck did he say?

It couldn't last, they had to crash
Some parties are just made that way
But when the bell rings, the boys will sing
Swing low sweet precariat
"Let's say we try to get this right"
Said the plutocrat to Jesus Christ
And when the old fox, fearing the worst
Made his entrance in a hearse
Then the nine in black robes all went berserk
This is a tale of Robin Hood in reverse
Citizens united, I was excited
When the kids are united, they can never be divided
But that was yesterday
There's a brand new sham to today
"Let's say we try to get this right"
Said the plutocrat to Jesus Christ
And when the old fox, fearing the worst
Made his entrance in a hearse
Then the nine in black robes all went berserk
