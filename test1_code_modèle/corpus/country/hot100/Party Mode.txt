Hey
Well, there ain't no changin' how it all wound up
She took off flyin' in a cloud of dust
Now, I ain't sayin' that it don't hurt
But I got a ninety-proof way to make it work


Drinkin' every single drink
Seven nights a week
All over this town
Doin' that thing I do
Runnin' from the truth
And burnin' it down in


Party mode, party mode, party mode
That's how it goes, how it goes, how it goes
Neon lights, honky-tonks 'til they close
Party mode, party mode, party mode


Hey
I sure do miss her and what we had
But there ain't no future in lookin' back
So I keep on rollin' and movin' on
I hope she comes back, but if she don't, I'll be
You might also like
Drinkin' every single drink
Seven nights a week
All over this town
Doin' that thing I do
Runnin' from the truth
Bartender, one more round


Party mode, party mode, party mode
That's how it goes, how it goes, how it goes
Neon lights, honky-tonks 'til they close
Party mode, party mode, party mode




Oh, I'll be drinkin' every single drink
Seven nights a week
At every bar in this town
Doin' that thing I do
Runnin' from the truth
And burnin' it down in


Party mode, party mode, party mode
That's how it goes, how it goes, how it goes
Neon lights, honky-tonks 'til they close
Party mode, party mode, party mode

Oh, party mode
Yeah, that's how it goes
Them neon lights and them honky-tonks
Party mode
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how it goes, man
Them neon lights and them honky-tonks
YeahEmbed
