There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue
I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell


It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the train rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float


You remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town
When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leaving tonight
You might also like
It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the trains rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float


Float
Float


There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue
People ruin people, I don't wanna ruin you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?


And I'm finally gone from Austin
You finally settled down
With a man who didn't move as quick
As the trains that rolled through town
I finally had to face
The hard times I've let go
If loving you was an ocean
I'd have drowned so you could float
