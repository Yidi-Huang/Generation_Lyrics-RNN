Roosevelt Road was too rough for my old truck
Yeah, she’d shake and she’d shimmy like Elvis singin’ “All Shook Up”
You can’t blame a boy for going drive-it-like-you-stole-it fast
With your window down, brown hair, blowin’ look at me like that


A turned-up radio but the static was heavy
Couldn’t make out any words but “take me to the levee”
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Soakin’ my soul in gas and settin’ my heart on fire

Heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire


I don’t have a single second thought that doesn’t have you in it
To feel those flames again, I'd go back in a New York minute
I miss the freedom of you dancin' on the bow of your daddy’s old boat
When my spirit starts sinkin’, that picture always make it float, baby


We weren’t old enough to drink, but we damn sure did it
Hat turned backward, singin’ “Paradise City”
That look on your face was full of young desire
Soakin’ my soul in gas and settin’ my heart on fire


Heart on fire


Turned-up radio but the static was heavy
