High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you
Live a lie
Live a lie
Live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine
(Chorus)
Because when I arrive
I... I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is he says, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Now the son's discrased
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine
You might also like(Chorus...)
Because when I arrive
I... I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is he says, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Lil Wayne
Yeah!
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gunna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like in july
And pay my lie

(ROCK)
(ROCK)
(ROCK)

Im in here up like b***h what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can f**k you up
I can f**k you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big xx rocks like off the ground
Baby like socks thats on the ground, Weezy
(Chorus) (x2)
Because when I arrive
I... I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is he says, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Just Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Let It Rock

Lil Wayne
Im back like I forgot somethin
Im somethin
Rollin' Rock rubbin' rap
Runnin' miles like I'm trying to get a flat
Stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll f**k ya
Period, Like the remainder

Kevin Rudolph

I wish I could be
As cool as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No not this timeEmbed
