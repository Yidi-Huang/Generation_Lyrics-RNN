the way you move is like a full on rainstorm and i'm a house of cards _ you're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin' _ but i kinda know that i won 't get far _ and you stood there in front of me , just close enough to touch _ close enough to hope you couldn 't see what i was thinkin' of _ drop everything now , meet me in the pouring rain _ kiss me on the sidewalk , take away the pain _ 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile _ get me with those green eyes , baby , as the lights go down _ give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around _ 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile _ my mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea _ you touch me once and it 's really somethin' _ you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be _ i'm on my guard for the rest of the world _ but with you , i know it 's no good _ and i could wait patiently , but i really wish you would _ drop everything now , meet me in the pouring rain _ kiss me on the sidewalk , take away the pain _ 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile _ get me with those green eyes , baby , as the lights go down _ give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around _ 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile _ you might also like _ i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild _ just keep on keepin' your eyes on me , it 's just wrong enough to make it feel right _ and lead me up the staircase , won 't you whisper soft and slow ? _ i'm captivated by you , baby , like a firework show _ drop everything now , meet me in the pouring rain _ kiss me on the sidewalk (ah-ah), take away the pain _ 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile _ get me with those green eyes , baby , as the lights go down _ give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around _ 'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile _ and the sparks fly _ oh , baby , smile _ and the sparks fly
took a deep breath in the mirror _ he didn 't like it when i wore high heels _ but i do _ turn the lock and put my headphones on _ he always said he didn 't get this song _ but i do , i do _ i walked in , expecting you 'd be late _ but you got here early and you stand and wave _ i walk to you _ you pull my chair out and help me in _ and you don 't know how nice that is _ but i do _ and you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid _ i think it 's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did _ i've been spending the last eight months _ thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end _ but on a wednesday , in a café , i watched it begin again _ you said you never met one girl who _ had as many james taylor records as you _ but i do _ we tell stories and you don 't know why _ i'm comin' off a little shy _ but i do _ you might also like _ but you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid _ i think it 's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did _ i've been spending the last eight months _ thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end _ but on a wednesday , in a café , i watched it begin again _ and we walked down the block to my car _ and i almost brought him up _ but you start to talk about the movies _ that your family watches every single christmas _ and i wanna talk about that _ and for the first time , what 's past is past _ 'cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid _ i think it 's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did _ i've been spending the last eight months _ thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end _ but on a wednesday , in a café , i watched it begin again _ hmm , hmm _ but on a wednesday , in a café , i watched it begin again
it 's strange to think the songs we used to sing _ the smiles , the flowers , everything is gone _ yesterday , i found out about you _ even now , just lookin' at you feels wrong _ you say that you 'd take it all back _ given one chance _ it was a moment of weakness _ and you said yes _ you should've said no , you should've gone home _ you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go _ you should've known that word _ 'bout what you did with her 'd get back to me (get back to me) _ and i should've been there , in the back of your mind _ i shouldn 't be asking myself why _ you shouldn 't be begging for forgiveness at my feet _ you should've said no _ baby , and you might still have me _ you can see that i've been cryin' _ and baby , you know all the right things to say _ but do you honestly expect me to believe _ we could ever be the same ? _ you might also like _ you say that the past is the past _ you need one chance _ it was a moment of weakness _ and you said yes _ you should've said no , you should've gone home _ you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go _ you should've known that word _ 'bout what you did with her’d get back to me (get back to me) _ and i should've been there , in the back of your mind _ i shouldn 't be asking myself why _ you shouldn 't be begging for forgiveness at my feet _ you should've said no _ baby , and you might still have me _ oh , oh _ i can 't resist _ before you go , tell me this _ was it worth it ? _ was she worth this ? _ no , no _ no , no , no , no _ you should've said no , you should've gone home _ you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go _ you should've known that word _ 'bout what you did with her’d get back to me (get back to me) _ and i should've been there , in the back of your mind _ i shouldn 't be asking myself why _ you shouldn 't be begging for forgiveness at my feet _ you should've said no _ baby , and you might still have me
