You can feel it, feel it



They say my system is overloaded

I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Mm-mm

My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'

Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone


This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body 
Ain't no time to deny it , that is why we talking about it 
Yeah, we talking about it 
To deal with it, don't try to get by it 
Ain't no time to deny it 
So we had to sit down and just write it 


Want you to get better 
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs

Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mm-mm?

Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this? 


Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is 
Before I'm gone

This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body 
Ain't no time to deny it , that is why we talking about it 

Yeah, we talking about it 
To deal with it, don't try to get by it 
Ain't no time to deny it 
So we had to sit down and just write it 


You can work your way to the top 

Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops 

Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked" 

Just know there is so much room at the top 




Well, here's one thing you can trust 
It take you and me to make us 
One of those days you had enough , I'll be there 
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another 
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble 
I'll be right there just to hug you , I'll be there 
Where are you? Are you home? 
Call me right on the phone 
I'll be there , yeah, I'll be there 
I don't care who is gone , you shouldn't be alone 
I'll be there , there

You can work your way to the top  

Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops 

Unfollow fear and just say, "You are blocked" 

Just know there is so much room at the top 

No matter what



Here's one thing you can trust 
It take you and me to make us 
One of those days you had enough , I'll be there, I'll be there 
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another 
If you need someone to pull you out the bubble 
I'll be right there just to hug you , I'll be there 
Where are you? Are you home?  Call me right on the phone 
I'll be there , yeah, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone , you shouldn't be alone 
I'll be there, ooh, there
