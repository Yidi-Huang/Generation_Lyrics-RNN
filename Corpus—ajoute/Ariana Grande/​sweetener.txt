When life deals us cards 
Make everything taste like it is salt 
Then you come through like the sweetener you are  
To bring the bitter taste to a halt  


And then you get it, get it, get it, get it 
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it 
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 


I like the way  you lick the bowl 
Somehow your method touches  my soul 
It lifts me up  to heights unknown 
So when they ask, "How's life?"  I go 


When life deals us cards 
Make everything taste like it is salt 
Then you come through like the sweetener you are  
To bring the bitter taste to a halt  

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it 
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it 
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 


Your mama sent  us horoscopes 
Had so much fun  watching them unfold 
You said she like me, I smile , I know 
So when they ask, "How’s life?"  I go 


When life deals us cards 
Make everything taste like it is salt 
Then you come through like the sweetener you are  
To bring the bitter taste to a halt  


And then you get it, get it, get it, get it 
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it 
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin’ you 'cause you make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
 Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life , it'd be so sour 
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours 


When life deals us cards 
Make everything taste like it is salt 
Then you come through like the sweetener you are 
To bring the bitter taste to a halt 


And then you get it, get it, get it, get it 
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it 
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it 
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it 
You make me say, "Oh,"  "Oh" 
You make me say, "Oh," babe


Hey, ayy, oh, yeah
