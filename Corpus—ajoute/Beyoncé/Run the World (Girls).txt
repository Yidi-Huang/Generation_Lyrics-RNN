Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do, but no, they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us, no, they won't
Boy, don't even try to touch this 
Boy, this beat is crazy 
This is how they made me 
Houston, Texas, baby
This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rockin' the latest
Who will buy it for themselves
And get more money later
I think I need a barber 
None of these **** can fade me 
I'm so good with this
I remind you, I'm so hood with this

Boy, I'm just playin'
Come here, baby
Hope you still like me
F-U, pay me


My persuasion can build a nation 
Endless power, with our love, we can devour 
You'll do anythin' for me

I'm reppin' for the girls who takin' over the world
Help me raise a glass for the college grads

This goes out to all the women gettin' it in
You on your grind
To other men that respect what I do
Please accept my shine

How we smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children 
Then get back to business
