Ooh, ooh
Oh, I know it ain't the same


I wish I could believe you, then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now, my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied


I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment


Just can't seem to get over 
The way you hurt me 
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no 
The very thing you gave to me 
I thought I could forgive you 
And I know you've changed 
As much as I wanna trust you 
I know it ain't the same 
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time 
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like 
I haven't tried to forget this 
But I'm much too full of resentment 
I may never understand why 
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I 
I tried and I tried to forget this 
But I'm much too full of resentment 


I'll always remember feelin' 
Like I was no good 
Like I couldn't do it for you 
Like your mistress could 
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever 
More than my own life 
But that part of me I gave you 
It was sacrificed 
And it's all because you lied


I only give you a hard time 
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like 
I tried and I tried to forget this 
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', "What's up with B?"
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes 
And see she's had half of me 
How could you lie?
