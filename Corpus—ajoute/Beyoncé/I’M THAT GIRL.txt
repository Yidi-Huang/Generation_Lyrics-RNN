Please, motherfuckers ain't stop—, please, motherfuckers
Please, mother—, please, mother—, please, motherfuckers
Please-please, mother—, please, mother—, please, mother—, please, mother—
Please, motherfuckers, please, mother—, please, mother—
Plеase-please, mothеrfuckers ain't stoppin' me
Please, motherfuckers ain't stoppin' me
Please, motherfuckers ain't stoppin' me
Please, motherfuckers ain't stoppin' me




I pull up in these clothes, look so good


'Cause I'm in that ho

You know all these songs sound good



'Cause I'm on that ho

Deadass


Deadass

I'm deadass





It's not the diamonds
It's not the pearls
I'm that girl 
It's just that I'm that girl 
It's not my man 
It's not my stance 
I'm that girl 
It's just that I'm that girl


From the top of the mornin', I shine 
Right through the blinds 
Touching everything in my plain view
And everything next to me gets lit up too 
You see it , yeah
You see it when you look to me
I didn't want this power 
I didn't want this power 


You know love is my weakness
Don't need drugs for some freak shit
I'm just high all the time, I'm out of my mind
I'm tweakin' 

Freakin' on the weekend 
I'm indecent , let it begin 
I be pullin' up in that '92 DeVille Cadillac with them vogues , losin' my mind 
Be-be-beastin' 
Un-American , I don't need no friends 
I been thuggin' for my  un-American life lights  in these D-Flawless skies 
Off the deep end 
Such a heathen , why they let me outside? 
I pull relief in 
Bring that beat in , now I can breathe again 
I be beatin' down the block , knockin' Basquiats off the wall-all 
That's how I ball
Cleanse me of my sins
My un-American life


Please, motherfuckers ain't stop—, please, motherfuckers
Please, mother—, please, mother—, please, motherfuckers
Please-please, mother—, please, mother—, please, mother—, please, mother—
Please, motherfuckers, please, mother—, please, mother—
Please-please, motherfuckers ain't stoppin' me
Please, motherfuckers ain't stoppin' me
Please, motherfuckers ain't stoppin' me
Please, motherfuckers
