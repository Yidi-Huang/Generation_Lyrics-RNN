All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin' 
Everything is cool between us, Bey, I told you that 
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do 
Thereâ€™s nothin' goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on
You got to trust me, ma


I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I've got


Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend

You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop callin' me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got


Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend



I know that I will never disappoint myself

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out

Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way

After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself

I've cried, all the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out

Yeah, yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way

After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

Yeah
Oh , oh 
Oh , oh 
Oh , oh 
Oh , woah 
Yeah, yeah



Me, myself, and I

I have cried so many times

I can't regret time spent with you

After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again, oh

I know that I will never disappoint myself

If you've cried a thousand times, ladies, you will survive

Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way

I can see the sun shine, I got me, myself and I
