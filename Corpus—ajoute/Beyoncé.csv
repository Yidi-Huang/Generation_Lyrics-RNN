Beyoncé,MOOD 4 EVA,"
I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up, now my view panoramic
None of my fears can go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levee, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner
The rain and thunder gon' pour
Go Mutumbo, no, no sinner
You can't dim my light


'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
Don't make me have to remind you

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
I promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever


Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up


Forever, and ever-ever, and ever-ever 
At the Saxon Madiba suite  like Mandela
Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos 
Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels 
That's a billi', a thousand milli' 
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye, no kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier , I'm on La Tâche
Helmet on the jet ski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, figured out me 
Oh my God, without the God in the XY 
I'm afraid the whole game will be colonized 
The marathon will be televised for N.I.P. ​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood


When we walk up in the club
I need the sirens goin' off
And when you look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
The children are our reminder


I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

Forever and ever
Ever, forever
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now


All praise due
My enemies still pressed
Cannot lose
'Cause I bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now, I move better, ooh
Energy pourin' out
I feel a change comin' now
Royalty in my blood from the kingdom
The more money, more problems season
But don't you let that get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh


I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
Forever and ever"
Beyoncé,Partition,"

Let me hear you say, ""Hey, Ms. Carter!"" 
Say, ""Hey, Ms. Carter!"" 
Give me somethin'


See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe


Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe 
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe 
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe


Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, ""Speed it up,"" I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

Part II: ""Partition""





Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seein' 'Yoncé on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh, there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club


Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me


Driver, roll up the partition fast 
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me ""Peaches"" when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash


Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you rip my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' off my hair
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me 


Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent


Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me

Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh, my, oh, my
Been havin' conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feelin' like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
If we are, we're takin' this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
With me bein' wherever I'm at
Worried 'bout wherever you are
We're takin' this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holdin' back on this and let's get carried away


Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

From eight until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights, I don't know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep, yeah
This whole thing got way too deep and we should


Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm askin' for but you
Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away

I miss feelin' on you 
I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you, that's just how I feel about you 
Been about you and I'm still about you, but
We ain't finished talkin' 
I told you you don't need to worry 'bout them bitches
All them fives need to listen when a ten is talkin' 
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And, girl, you swear they all your friends and that's been a problem 
You the one they hate, this come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a runnin' back
But that nigga came runnin' back 
And you tell me you done with that
And I believe it's true
Long as you know who you belong to


All I'm really askin' for is you

I never broke one promise

If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is


I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair"
Beyoncé,Halo,"Remember those walls I built?

To pull me back to the ground again

You dreamt of being in my world

Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
Part II: ***Flawless

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important 
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support 
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? 
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing 
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are 
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes 

You wake up , post up 
Riding 'round in it , flossin' on that 
This diamond , my diamond

My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless

You wake up , post up

Beyoncé,Love Drought,"Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware


You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm


'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought


Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad

But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack

There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind


So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged the bullet, uh
I'm so over you, so baby, good lookin' out


I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh, yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now


So sad, uh, you're hurt, boo-hoo
Oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good lookin' out


I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now


I know you want me back, it's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away, Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye


I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that 
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had

I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger is like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast, mafioso
""Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?""
""No, not the car, but everywhere we are""

Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you

Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me

I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame 
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

When I talk to my friends so quietly
 Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you

They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes, sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers

How you think I got the name Hova?

I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young

Ever since I made the change over to platinum

The game's been a wrap, one

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care

You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that

And it ain't no need to cry

Now that it's over, stop callin' me, come pick up your clothes

I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment


Just can't seem to get over

Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no 
The very thing you gave to me 
I thought I could forgive you 
And I know you've changed 
As much as I wanna trust you 
I know it ain't the same

I only give you a hard time

I'm doin' the best that I can, and I 
I tried and I tried to forget this 
But I'm much too full of resentment 


I'll always remember feelin' 
Like I was no good 
Like I couldn't do it for you 
Like your mistress could 
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever 
More than my own life 
But that part of me I gave you 
It was sacrificed 
And it's all because you lied


I only give you a hard time 
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like 
I tried and I tried to forget this 
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', ""What's up with B?""
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes 
And see she's had half of me

My daddy Alabama, momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag

I see it, I want it, I stunt; yellow bone-it
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on them haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off , I go hard 
Get what's mine , I'm a star 
'Cause I slay , I slay , I slay , I slay 
All day , I slay , I slay , I slay 
We gon' slay , gon' slay , we slay , I slay

When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster, 'cause I slay
When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster, we gon' slay
If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper, I slay
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up, 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, 'cause I slay
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making, 'cause I slay

Beyoncé,No Angel,"Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm a problem

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby


No, I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying

Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you


Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se


Hold up, they don't love you like I love you

Slow down, they don't love you like I love you


Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Beyoncé,Superpower,"When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different from when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is, yeah
And when my voice is screamin' out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standin' in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing's a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Movin' forward



A subtle power 
A tough love 
Oh, like a shark 
Ooh, like a bear, a tough love


And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
It couldn't slow us down
And I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

And just like you, I can't be scared
And just like you, I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love 
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky and what falls
It's a superpower 
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together, we got plenty superpower

Beyoncé,Pretty Hurts,"Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy


Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down


Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation 
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar-free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down


Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation 

Pretty hurts 
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery


Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst 
Perfection is a disease of a nation 
Pretty hurts 
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something 
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery


When you're alone all by yourself 
And you're lyin' in your bed

You stripped away the masquerade 
The illusion has been shed 
Are you happy with yourself? 
Are you happy with yourself? 
Yeah, yes "

Beyoncé,If I Were a Boy,"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me


If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed


If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted 
'Cause he's taken you for granted 
And everything you had got destroyed


It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong


But you're just a boy
You don't understand 
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts

Beyoncé,Daddy Lessons,"Yee-haw
Ooh
Texas, Texas  Texas


Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me 
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand 
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea


And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
And oh, that's when he gave to me


With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Ooh
Yee, woo
Ooh
Yee-haw 


Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, ""Girl, it's your second amendment"" 
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, ""Remember...""


He said, ""Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister""
That's when Daddy looked at me


With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot 
Oh, my daddy said shoot 
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot 

Ooh 
Ooh 
Ooh 
Ooh 


My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, ""Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you"" 
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, ""Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you 
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around""

Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?
Ooh, grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know that you ready 
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady


And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me


Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Bathe in these waterfalls, uh

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Baby, I'll put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls


So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

The winner is: Beyoncé Knowles, female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin' solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder, ""How come?""
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm lookin' off the edge, I preach my gut, it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbin' up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is borin'
All the shit I do is borin', all these record labels borin'
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive, how come?

Part II: ""Haunted""


It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be hauntin' me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay


My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me

Beyoncé,Listen,"Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release


Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen


Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago


Oh, I'm screamin' out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen


Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own


I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete, oh-oh

I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

Beyoncé,Pray You Catch Me,"You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world


Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me


Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb


Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering 
I pray you catch me 
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me 
I'm praying you catch me

What are you doing, my love?"
Beyoncé,Sandcastles,"We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way


Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way


And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way"
