Ed Sheeran,Overpass Graffiti,"This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love


Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me


Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass, yeah
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Ooh, graffiti on the overpass"
Ed Sheeran,Bibia Be Ye Ye,"Bibia be ye ye


I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day


Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye


Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye


I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye


Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 


Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye


Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye 
Wo nooma 
Bibia be ye ye

Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye

Ed Sheeran,Save Myself,"I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song
It goes on and on


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't, then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself"
Ed Sheeran,Visiting Hours,"I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you


Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right


Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away"
Ed Sheeran,Barcelona,"Well, get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it


And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street


In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona


Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street


In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona


Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia 
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo, mi cariño 
Mamacita, rica
Sí, tú, te adoro, señorita 
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Nosotros, viva la vida
Siempre vida, Barcelona"
Ed Sheeran,Tenerife Sea,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us


Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
I'm so in love


You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love


Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me


Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment, I knew you best"
Ed Sheeran,Supermarket Flowers,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink


Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""


I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""








Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""
Ed Sheeran,Hearts Don’t Break Around Here,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one-way trip
Guess she went wanderin' off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole


Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately, I know


That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah


She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh

Roses, roses laid upon your bedspread, oh my
Oh, this, oh, this, I know


But every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah


Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passin' over
Or the thought of growin' old
'Cause from now until I go


Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah
Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Ed Sheeran,Eraser,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothin' could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this **** should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah


Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser


And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser"
Ed Sheeran,Afire Love,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that Heaven is your restin' place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lyin' in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them


And my father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing


Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

Love, love


And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now, we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standin' in the rain
And now, my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when


My father told me, ""Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing


Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

 Love, love
 See the love, the love, the love, the love
 See the love, the love, the love, the love
 See the love, the love, the love, the love


And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing ""Hallelujah""
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing ""Hallelujah""
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing ""Hallelujah""

And my father and all of my family 
Rise from their seats to sing ""Hallelujah""



 See the love, the love, the love, the love
 See the love, the love, the love, the love
 See the love, the love, the love, the love

Ed Sheeran,Shape of You,"A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now 
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date 
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate 
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay 
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""

Ed Sheeran,Sing,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady


I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh


This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won't you let me know?
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

Louder!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh


Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here, so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!
 I need you, darling
 Come on, set the tone
 If you feel you're fallin'
 Won't you let me know?
Louder!
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh 
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

Ed Sheeran,Lego House,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you, mm


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now"

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man"
Ed Sheeran,"You Need Me, I Don’t Need You","I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend


Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now 
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you"
Ed Sheeran,Don’t,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'


Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing


Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
Ed Sheeran,U.N.I.,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missin' you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never gettin' dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not


So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down, come around
Break-up the love like LEGO now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying, every day, that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss


So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied

Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down 
And I'm thinkin' I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep lookin' around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will


'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied"
Ed Sheeran,Happier,"Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new


'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?


Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you

But ain't nobody need you like I do

I know that there's others that deserve you

But, my darlin', I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you"
Ed Sheeran,Take It Back,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin', ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still, they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then, I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet
I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
I'll take it back now

Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made
And, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no, mmm"
Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me


'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight


Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight


No, no, no
Mm, no, no


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight"
Ed Sheeran,Afterglow,"


Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow"
Ed Sheeran,I’m a Mess,"Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how?
Going through the motions, going through us


And, oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach


I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hopin' you'd stop

And, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach


And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now? 
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?

For how long, long I love my lover now, now?

For how long, long I love my lover now, now?

For how long, long I love my lover now, now?

For how long, long I love my lover now, now?


For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover?"
Ed Sheeran,What Do I Know,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels""


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me
Just love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's comin', it's a minute away
I saw people marchin' in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people followin' their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows

Ed Sheeran,Eyes Closed,"I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else


I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе


Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you 


I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on


So I'm dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Oh, I keep dancin' with my

They're shutting the bar, they're cleanin' the floor
And everyone is already home
But I'm on my own


Still dancin' with my eyes closed

And I don't know what else that I can do

Ed Sheeran,Best Part of Me,"My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself


Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself


'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum


Baby, the best part of me is you 
Lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

Ed Sheeran,Beautiful People,"We are, we are, we are


L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown 
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 


L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care


We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Ed Sheeran,All of the Stars,"It's just another night and I'm starin' at the moon
I saw a shootin' star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you


You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playin' ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love

So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beatin' to


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


And, oh, I know
And, oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From America"
Ed Sheeran,Shivers,"I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks

And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm

You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver

Ed Sheeran,Small Bump,"You're just a small bump unborn
In four months, you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life


And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right


Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right


And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe


'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"
Ed Sheeran,Nina,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again


Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again


Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?


Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina

'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina

Oh, won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road, Nina

But then again, you should know, Nina

'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina

Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina

'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina

Oh, won't you leave me now?

And I've been living on the road, Nina

But then again, you should know, Nina

'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Ed Sheeran,The Joker And The Queen,"How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen



And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me

Ed Sheeran,Bad Habits,"
Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

Ed Sheeran,Nancy Mulligan,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried 'bout the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

Ed Sheeran,Take Me Back To London,"Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London 


I do deals, but I never get twanged 
Moves that ain't ever been planned 
No goons that were never in gangs 
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride , he shoot a guy 
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone


It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault 
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour 
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? 
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael 
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London


Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs 
And you can do Glasto 
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home 
So take me back to London
So take me back to London"
Ed Sheeran,Thinking Out Loud,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three


And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am


So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are


When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul who could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand


That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh


Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love


So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
Ed Sheeran,Bloodstream,"Na-na-na-na
Mmm


I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Well, tell me when it kicks in


I've been lookin' for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in


Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Callin' out across the line
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Callin' out across the line 

So, tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
And tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted"

Ed Sheeran,How Would You Feel (Paean),"You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too



Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?

Ed Sheeran,The A Team,"White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

To fly, to fly

Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms


And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes

Ed Sheeran,Dive,"Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Oh, baby, I apologise for it


I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake


So don't call me ""baby""
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you


You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history? 
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake every day
Don't know how much I can take


So don't call me ""baby""
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you




Mm, I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me ""baby""
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it

Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
And before I dive right into you"
Ed Sheeran,Castle On The Hill,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
Ed Sheeran,Photograph,"Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home


Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die

Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home


Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home


Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home"""
Ed Sheeran,Wake Me Up,"I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again and just replace it
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter
I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek 'cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hopin' for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today, you shoulda got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then, you'd laugh at me and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then, you'd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now


'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Oh, maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"
Ed Sheeran,One,"Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave


And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me, ooh


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one


Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes
But we'll be strangers if we see this through

You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh, Lord, now


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one


Stumblin' half-drunk, gettin' myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singin' about love
And where it goes wrong


And all my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one"
Ed Sheeran,I See Fire,"Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons


If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high


And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me


And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out


Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire 
And I see fire 
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side"
Ed Sheeran,Galway Girl,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""


I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl "
Ed Sheeran,Remember the Name,"Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy


I can still remember  tryna shop a deal 
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it , became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell  if I'd prevail 
And all I did was  put nine-inch nails 
In my eyelids now 
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales 
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said


It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again


You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
