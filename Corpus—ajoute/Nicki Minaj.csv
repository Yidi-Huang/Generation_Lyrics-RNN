Nicki Minaj,Barbie Dreams,"Uh, mmm, kyuh
R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit


I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers 
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'


I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said ""tre-way""
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 
Dreams of fuckin' one of these little rappers 
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 

I'm just playin', but I'm sayin' 


You know I'm all 'bout them dollars
I be supportin' them scholars
I let him give me some brain, but he wanted me to ride it
So I said, ""Fuck it, I'm in""
He wanna cut like a trim
And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted
I'm poppin', I'm uninvited
I said, ""Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it""
I ride his **** in a circle
I turn Stefan into Urkel
I go arounds and arounds and I'ma go down in slow motion
The-then I pick it up, look at it
I said, ""Daddy, come get at it,"" uh
Yellow brick road, he said that I am a wiz at it
Yeah, they want it, want it
You know I flaunt it, flaunt it
I'm a trendsetter, everything I do, they do
Yeah, I put 'em up on it, on it
¡Dimelo, papi, papi!
Yo quiero sloppy, sloppy
I'll give it to you if you beat it up like Pacqui, Pacqui
I-I-I-I'ma kill 'em with the shoe
No ceiling is in the roof
And I'm big, give me the loot
12 cylinders in the coupe
I get dome with the chrome, no tellin' when I'ma shoot
I just bang, bang, bang, real killas is in my group
Gorillas is in my unit, vacationin' where it's humid
And I shine, shine, shine, got diamonds all in my cubans
I'm in LA Times more than when niggas lootin'
And my flow spit crack, I think that nigga usin'
He done bodied everybody, in closing, these bitches losin'
Usin', usin' up, a bitch movin'
No, I ain't stuttered and no, I ain't Ruben
Damn, a bitch snoozin'
Shoutout to my Jews, l'chaim, Rick Rubin
Big fat titties, yes, they be protrudin'
I be like, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, bring the lube in
I be like, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, bring the lube in"

All these bitches is my sons
And I'ma go and get some bibs for 'em
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em 
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals, I might break you off
And we ain't making up, I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator

This stone is flawless, F1
I keep shooters up top in the F1
A lot of bad bitches beggin' me to F one
But I'ma eat them rap bitches when the chef come
Throw some fresh ones
More talent in my motherfuckin' left thumb
She ain't a Nicki fan, then the bitch deaf, dumb
You ain't my son, you my motherfuckin' step-son

All these bitches is my sons
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Phoenix
Bitch, I get money, so I dos what I pleases
I live where the motherfuckin' pools and the trees is
Broke bitches so crusty 
Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff'-B
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me, ew
I'm the terminator
Bitch talk slick, I'ma have to terminate her
These little nappy-headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I'll spray you with the germinator 
Move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know the queen could use a back rub 
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used to be here, now you're gone, Nair

Nicki Minaj,Buy a Heart,"You should say it right now

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?


Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?


Its a heart for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's lying"
Nicki Minaj,Moment 4 Life,"I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slay Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of 
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive


What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees

Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive


This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive


I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

Nicki Minaj,Chun-Li,"Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench

That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who-who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy

You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top

I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli


All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin

So me and you ain't ever in the same room


I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't never cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' ""push"" for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him

Nicki Minaj,All Things Go,"Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""


All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go


I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go 
We wake back up and do it all again 
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become 
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me


All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go


I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go 
We wake back up and do it all again 
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become 
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, ""We did it""
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

Tryna forgive you for abandoning me

Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me

Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'

Higher, higher, more fire

Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays

How you go on Gayle King and can't cry?
Chile, bye

Swearin' on your dead mother when you lie 


This lil' beggin' whore talkin' 'bout Megan's Law
For a free beat, you could hit Megan raw 
If you a ghostwriter, party in Megan jaw 
Shots thrown, but I still ain't let Megan score 
Bad bitch, she like six foot , I call her Big Foot 
The bitch fell off, I said, ""Get up on your good foot""
Uh, still ain't topped ""Red Ruby"" 
Tryna steal the sauce, I said, ""Get up out my cookbook""

P-R-T-T-Y, but I'm P-E-T-T-Y 
Um, why did you lie about your lipo?
Fuckin' your best friend man is crazy, you the type, though

The thirty-year-old tea so stale
Kylie kicked you out and made you stumble to the car
Barbz, I need a good alcohol bar
Roman, wait, that was the bar

Mm, yeah, sorta like French
They got you all them Grammys, but your flow's still a no
What a fiasco, Lupe
Future made you pay 
She wanna party with DaBaby while rubbin' on Tory toupée
I guess she needed money bags for them Trey Songz
She G-Eazy, Carl made her crawl for it
Yo, why the fuck they poke the monster?
Fuckin' with Nicki this year, ho, I'm comin' like a pornstar
She just mad that no nigga ever loved her
No nigga gon' stand ten toes behind her
Is it my fault I got good vagin-er?
Why the fuck is you humpin' on a minor?
'Cause she was lyin' on your dead mama , on-on your dead mama 
Lyin' on your dead mama, on-on your dead mama
Lyin' on your dead mama, lyin' on your dead mama
Lyin' on your, lyin', lyin', lyin' on your dead mama 

Now listen up, Big Foot
You know I got a lotta tea
I went easy on you
Umm 
You know, whenever I meet a woman that would fuck her friend's man

I know that , they have a very evil spirit
Um 
I don't think you want the next installment of this song
I know it's the most attention you've ever gotten
One-flow ho, but, uh, trust
If you don't apologize to your mama in twenty-four hours
Shit gon' get uglier than KenBarbie, okay? Don't play
Um, and also, I'd like to say
To my supporters, I love you, may God bless you, you're amazing
Um, all the good-pussy gyal dem too, yes
But
I'm very serious
Ho, the things that you've lied about
Even pertaining to your mom
You don't want them out, okay?
Now
Since you think it's funny to speak about people's families
We'll all join in
We'll all play the reindeer games

Nicki Minaj,High School,"He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone


They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? 
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? 

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune


They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and

Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin', be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learn that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earn that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you when, really, they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you outta niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you

Nicki Minaj,Bed of Lies,"Oh-oh-oh, yeah


Do you ever think of me when you lie? 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes 
They only pretend you would be mine
And, oh, how you made me believe 
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies


You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song


Do you ever think of me when you lie? 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes 
They only pretend you would be mine
And, oh, how you made me believe 
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies


I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before? 
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl 
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself 


Do you ever think of me when you lie? 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies 
And I knew better than to look in your eyes 
They only pretend you would be mine
And, oh, how you made me believe 
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? 
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies"

It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

But my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a wrap when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck 'cause all them bitches'll catch it

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, ""Don’t touch me"" 
I lied, I lied


I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, ""Let’s see""
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? Who knows? So, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, ""Fuck you"" 
I lied, I lied


I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic 


I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied

I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa


I lied, ooh, baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you 
It’s over now, goodbye, love

He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
""S"" on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me ""mama, lil' mama,"" I call him ""baby""

Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
""S"" on my chest, let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon
Convict just like Akon
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the jake on
