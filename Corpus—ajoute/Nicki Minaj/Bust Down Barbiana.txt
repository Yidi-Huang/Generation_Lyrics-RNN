Bust down, Barbiana, bust down, Barbiana
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up


Uh, ayo, I been a bad bitch, cockiana 
And I'm still winnin', Pacquiana 
Percocets, popiana, killin' everybody beat
Thank you, next, Ariana 
You gon' have to give me topiana 
If you tryna get some sloppiana 
I call my opps Oppiana 
Then shut down Yves Saint, Lauriana 
I don't want you on my page, blockiana 
Flow tailor made, like Teyana 
They copyin' my style, copiana
Roger that, over, copiana
Benihana to Katana, bitch, I been a Donna
He screamin' my government: O-Onika Tanya
You look like Nicki now, still you tacky-ana
To keep it 100, bitch you wacky-ana
In the hood like Kiana, or a Tatiana
Immigrant from Trinidad, rep Americana
I'm 'bout to shut it down at Met Galiana
You peanut head bitches is always jellyana
I'm 'bout to get a ring in my bellyana
Tattoo my man name, then give him some beckiana 
85, comma, plus three zeros 
Plus another comma plus three zeros 
Then add a dot 
Bop a dot dot, bop a dot dot doh
Been at the top
Before this song came out, bitch you been a thot 

Bust down, Barbiana, bust down, Barbiana 
Then back that shit up 
On the gang, then back that shit up 
On the mags, then back that shit up 
Bust down, Barbiana, bust down 
Then pick that shit up 
On the gang, Barbiana 
Bust down, bust down, Barbiana 


Uh
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust down and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up
Bust it open and pick that shit up
