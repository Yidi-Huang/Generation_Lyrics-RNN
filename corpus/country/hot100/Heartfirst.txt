Met him at a party
Accidentally brushed his body
On the way to get a drink at the bar
I couldn't wait 'til later
Talking in the elevator
Then we're kissing in the back of the car


That voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't see the way you lookin' at me right now
It may not be next week what I need
Then again, maybe it might be


Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yellin' that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in, baby, with my heart first


I gotta have it
Gotta see if this works
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt
You might also like
Who knows what'll happen
Ain't it always kinda magic
When you don't know who's holding the cards? (Ah-ah)
Could bе a wish I never knew ya
Or pеrmanently tattooed ya
Only the moon knows what's in the stars (What's in the stars)


Mmm, that voice in my head says to slow down
But it can't feel your hands on my hips right now
It may not be next year what I need
Then again, maybe it might be


Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yellin' that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in, baby, with my heart first


I gotta have it
Gotta see if this works (I gotta have it)
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt
I gotta have it
Diving in heart first (Diving in heart first)
I gotta have it
Ooh, I gotta have ya

And I can't even stop myself anymore
(Ooh, I gotta have it, yeah-yeah)
Oh, it could be the perfect night outside my front door


Could be forever or we might break
That's just the kind of risk that we take
My head is yellin' that I could get hurt
But I'm gonna jump right in, baby, with my heart first


I gotta have it
Gotta see if this works (I gotta have it)
I gotta have it
Wake up in your t-shirt (Wake up in your t-shirt, yeah)
I gotta have it
Diving in heart first (Diving in heart first)
I gotta have it
Yeah, I gotta have ya
