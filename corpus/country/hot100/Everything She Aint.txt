She ain't a peach you oughta be pickin'
She ain't the cup of tea you oughta be sippin'
She treats you like you're broke, like you need fixin'
You ain't gettin' nothing back for all that you're givin'
If you're good with who you're kissin', c'est la vie
But I can show you what you're missin', yeah boy I can be


The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is, and everything she ain't


She sees diamonds, but I'm seein' stars
You should leave her on an island
Dance with me in this bar
Honey, there's plenty of fish in the sea
But if you take a second look
You'll see there's only one of me


The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is, and everything she ain't
You might also like
She's all wrong for you
Just the girl next-door you know as right as rain


The whiskey in your soda, the lime to your Corona
Shotgun in your Tacoma, the Audrey to your Hank
She's got a little style and a Hollywood smile
But believe me, honey, good as money in the bank
I'm everything she is, and everything she ain't


Yeah, I'm everything she is, and everything she ain't
