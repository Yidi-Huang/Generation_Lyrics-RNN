Queen


Only on them C's if it's breeze, Red Ruby Da Sleeze  
Chinese on my sleeve, these wannabe Chun-Lis
Anyway, 你好 
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? 
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile 
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud 
Boom your face off, then I tell him, "Cease fire"
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave 
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves 

Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe


Bad gyal don't die-die-die 
Hundred rounds on that grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah
Bad gyal don't run from nobody, like ah
Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
And he know what to do if he ever miss me

Miss me with that na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I stay with my na-na-na-na-na-na-na
His ex hit him, he like, "Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah"
He want the bad gyal sleeze like that
Why I'm a tease like that?
Ill, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
He told me bring him that na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We don't be Karen like Donna-na-na-na-na-na
I like it when he grab my cheeks like that 
Why I'm a freak like that?


Bad gyal don't die-die-die
Hundred rounds on that grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah
Bad gyal don't run from nobody, like ah
Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
And he know what to do if he ever miss me


When the Queen leave, bitches wanna come out like a cockroach
Until I'm cookin' in the kitchen like a pot roast 
That new Spectre, we don't fill pot holes 
Dorito—bitches mad that they nachos
Shoutout my vatos
Shout out to hoes that's watchin' me like Movados 
All them, all them botched face photos, why would you post those?
Make a gyal duppy since I heard you like my ghost, hoes
Big truck but I'm alone like Post, though 
Call Malone and tell him I'm goin' postal 
These bitches rappin' like my blooper roll 
Desert Eagle if your nigga actin' super bold
 Got 'em like, "Uh-oh"
Gun fingers like niggas doin' the bogle
Ya fuckin' bozo
That .40 cal a make 'em dance like a go-go
Super fakks, that's word to Super Cat
We ah rude gyal youth and we nuh tek back we chat
'Cause bitches couldn't walk in my Crocs, that's word to Dundee
Just a bunch of airheads like Kelly Bundy
Man, these bitches so slow, man, they slower than sloths 
Six-hundred horse, how you gon' catch the boss?
Caught 'em with they hand out, tryna catch the sauce 
Thierry Mugler flow, tryna cut the cloth
See the difference is: I run businesses 
If I ain't employ you, then what ya business is?
I'll have staff roll up, like, "What the business is?" 
Oh, you don't know that my niggas kill witnesses?

Bad gyal don't die-die-die
Hundred rounds on that, grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah
Bad gyal don't run from nobody, like ah
Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
And he know what to do if he ever miss me, yeah

If you want me to stay
I'll never leave
If you want me to stay
We'll always be
If you want me to stay
Love endlessly
If you want me to stay
