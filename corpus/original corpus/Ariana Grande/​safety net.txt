Yeah


You know you're really something, yeah
How we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I’d feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track


I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind


Mmm
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl 
It's timе for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry storе and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts 
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out 
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day


I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind  


Mmm 
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said 
Is it real this time or is it in my head? 
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net



Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away

Girl, you got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

Boy, it must be something that you said 
Is it real this time or is it in my head?

Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net 


Oh hey
Ah yeah
