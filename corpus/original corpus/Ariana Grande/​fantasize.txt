Ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh, oh 


A few weeks ago
I saw you front row
And my heart stopped at the sight 
Thought you were solo 
But you got a girl though 
And my life ain't been the same
Been feelin'


Mentally, physically weak 
Boys blowin' up my phone 
They just ain't you, oh, baby
I'm meant to be on my own 
But just before I go 
There's something you should know
And boy, I


I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five
Five-to-nine
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of  way 
That just ain't me

A few months later
You're still togеther 
And you just can't tell mе why 
So, boy, stop pretendin' 
'Cause I won't keep waitin'
I'm out the door, bye, bye, bye 
Been feelin'


Mentally, physically weak  
Boys blowin' up my phone  
They just ain't you, oh, baby 
I'm meant to be on my own  
But just before I go  
There's something you should know 
And boy, I


I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine 
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five 
Five-to-nine 
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of  way 
That just ain't me

Ooh-ooh 

Ooh-ooh, oh 



Mentally, physically weak
Boys blowin' up my phone
They just ain't you, ooh, baby


I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine 
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five
Five-to-nine
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of way 
That just ain't me


Ooh-ooh  
That just ain't me, baby
Ooh-ooh, oh  
Tryna behave
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of way 
That just ain't me
