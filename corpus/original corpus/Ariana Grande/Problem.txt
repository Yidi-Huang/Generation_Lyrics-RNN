Uh-huh
It's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you, girl, ayy



Hey, baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya 
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to 
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it 


Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up 
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back 
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it 


Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem


It's Iggy Iggz
Uh, what you got?

Smart money, bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand, my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's, baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got ninety-nine problems, but you won't be one, like what?


Mm, yeah 
Mm, yeah 


Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders 
I should be wiser and realize that I've got 

One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem, babe 
One less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem
