Understand this, I'm not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been workin' every day 8 to 9 and
Serving Coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me


I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby


Understand this, I been likin' you since I was small
I don't wanna get you runnin' scared
When there's no pressure there at all
I been workin' 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by


I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

I'm the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid **** you got?
It's me you should be seein'


Hello-o-o you are lookin' so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a gold mine, gold mine
Askin' everybody, "Is he mine? Is he mine?"
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him


I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby
