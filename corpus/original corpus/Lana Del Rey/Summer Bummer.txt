It's never too late
To be who you wanna be

To say what you wanna say
And it's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave 
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby 
I got a feelin' in my bones
 
Can't get you out of my veins 
You can't escape my affection 
Wrap you up in my daisy chains 


Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm 

Uh, her sophistication make you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted 
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation 
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it 
But bang it like my fingers 
She pray to God I made it 
But bankin' like my Franklins 
My neighbors stopped the hatin' 
What? 
Huh? 
Slide inside it 
Diddy Boppin'  
Milly Rockin' 
She just might become my lover for real 
I might fuck with her all summer for real 
They better not holla if I cuff her for real 
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the wheel 
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out


Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm 

White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me have patience
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches


High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Don't be a bummer 
Don't be a bummer 


Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe 

Don't be a bummer, babe
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
