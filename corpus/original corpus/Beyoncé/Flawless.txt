Part I: "Bow Down"


I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground


I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches 
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches

Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches 
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches 
H-Town vicious, H-H-Town vicious
I'm so crown-crown, bow down, bitches

I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
Part II: ***Flawless

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important 
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support 
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? 
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing 
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are 
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes 

You wake up , post up 
Riding 'round in it , flossin' on that 
This diamond , my diamond

My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless

You wake up , post up 
Riding 'round in it , flossin' on that 
This diamond , my diamond 
This rock , my Roc 
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, "I look so good tonight" 
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, "I look so good tonight" 
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
