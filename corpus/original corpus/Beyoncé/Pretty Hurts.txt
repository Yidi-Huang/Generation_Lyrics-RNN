Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy


Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down


Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation 
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar-free
Vogue says thinner is better

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down


Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation 

Pretty hurts 
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery


Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake fa√ßade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst 
Perfection is a disease of a nation 
Pretty hurts 
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something 
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery


When you're alone all by yourself 
And you're lyin' in your bed 
Reflection stares right into you 
Are you happy with yourself? 
You stripped away the masquerade 
The illusion has been shed 
Are you happy with yourself? 
Are you happy with yourself? 
Yeah, yes
