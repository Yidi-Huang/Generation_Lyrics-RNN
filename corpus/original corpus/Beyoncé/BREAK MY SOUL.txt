Now, I just fell in love
And I just quit my job
I'm gonna find new drive
Damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine
Then off past five
And they work my nerves
That's why I cannot sleep at night

I'm lookin' for motivation
I'm lookin' for a new foundation, yeah
And I'm on that new vibration
I'm buildin' my own foundation, yeah
Hold up, oh, baby, baby

Release ya job, release the time
Release ya trade, release the stress
Release the love, forget the rest


I'ma let down my hair 'cause I lost my mind
Bey is back and I'm sleepin' real good at night
The queens in the front and the Doms in the back
Ain't takin' no flicks but the whole clique snapped
There's a whole lot of people in the house
Tryin' to smoke with the yak in your mouth
 And we back outside
You said you outside, but you ain't that outside
Worldwide hoodie with the mask outside
In case you forgot how we act outside

Got motivation 
I done found me a new foundation, yeah 
I'm takin' my new salvation 
And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah 
Oh, baby, baby


You won't break my soul 
You won't break my soul 
You won't break my soul 
You won't break my soul 
And I'm tellin' everybody 
Everybody

Everybody, yeah


If you don't seek it, you won't see it
That, we all know 
If you don't think it, you won't be it
That love ain't yours 
Tryin' to fake it never makes it
That, we all know 
You can have the stress and not take less
I'll justify love
We go 'round in circles, 'round in circles
Searchin' for love 
We go up and down, lost and found 
Searchin' for love 
Looking for something that lives inside me
Looking for something that lives inside me

You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
I'm tellin' everybody
Tellin' everybody
Everybody

You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul, no, no
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
And I'm tellin' everybody 
Everybody

I'm takin' my new salvation 
And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah 
Got motivation 
I done found me a new foundation, yeah

And I'ma build my own foundation, yeah
