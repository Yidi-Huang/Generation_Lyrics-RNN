All the single ladies 
All the single ladies 
All the single ladies 
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up


Up in the club , we just broke up 
I'm doin' my own lil' thing
You decided to dip  and now you wanna trip 
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him , he up on me 
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears , gave ya three good years 
You can't be mad at me


'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips , a man on my hips 
On me tighter than my Der√©on jeans
Actin' up , drink in my cup 
I can care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention?
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn  and now you gon' learn
What it really feels like to miss Bey


'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me 
And delivers me to a destiny
To infinity  and beyond 
Pull me  into your arms 
Say I'm the one you want 
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

All the single ladies 
All the single ladies 
All the single ladies 
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh


'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh
'Cause if you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you should've put a ring on it
Woah-oh-oh
