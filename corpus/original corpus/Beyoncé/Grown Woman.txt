I remember being young and so brave 
I knew what I needed 
I was spendin' all my nights and days 
Laid back day dreamin' 
Look at me, I'm a big girl now
Said I'm gon' do somethin' 
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this 


'Cause I put it down like that , d-down like that
And I'm makin' all these racks , a-all these racks 
And I'm movin' round like that , r-round like that 
When I do it, I don't look back, d-don't look back


I'm a grown woman 
I can do whatever I want 
I'm a grown woman 
I can do whatever I want 
I can be bad if I want 
I can do wrong if I want 
I can live fast if I want 
I can go slow all night long 
I'm a grown woman 
I can do whatever I want 

They love the way I walk 
'Cause I walk with a vengeance 
And they listen to me when I talk 
'Cause I ain't pretendin' 
It took a while, now I understand
Just where I'm goin' 
I know the world and I know who I am
It's 'bout time I show it

I'm a grown woman 
I can do whatever I want 
I can be bad if I want 
I can say what I want 
I can live fast if I want

I can do whatever I want 


I'm a grown woman 
And I know that I got it 
I'm a grown woman 
Ain't got no room in my pockets 
I'm a grown woman 
Look down, got you so excited, haha 
I really wanna know if you got it like that
'Cause you got a cute face and that booty so fat
Go, girl , she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl  can get whatever she wants
That girl , she got that tight, that tight
Them boys , they do whatever she likes
I'm a grown woman

Na mu so yukudu ba yasoman kudu
