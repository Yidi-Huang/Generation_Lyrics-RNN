Lana Del Rey,Fingertips,"When I look back, tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, ""I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two""


Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?


Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child
I guess I'll be fine


It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I
See nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you, if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my arms
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I
Ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die


When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time

Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die


Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry

Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite, as they bow down to me


Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me"

They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice, I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on amphetamines


I say
I say


Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Da-da-da-da-da-ya-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da


They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see


But I'm free, ooh
I'm free


Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

I'm talking 'bout my generation
I'm talking 'bout my newer nation
And if you don't like it, you can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it


And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby


Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da

Lana Del Rey,Happiness is a butterfly,"Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer


Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah


If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt


I said, ""Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi""
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you 
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you


Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah


Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy


If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, ""Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi""
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you


Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you 
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you"
Lana Del Rey,Love song,"In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you


Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I’m here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song


Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I’m a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud

It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song"
Lana Del Rey,Blue Jeans,"Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean  and love hurts 
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember 
Say you'll remember 
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin'  paper 
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember 
Say you'll remember 
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember 
Say you'll remember 
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time"
Lana Del Rey,Dark Paradise,"All my friends tell me  I should move on
I'm lyin' in the ocean, singin' your song
""Ah,"" That's how you sang it
Lovin' you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
""Ah,"" That's how we played it


And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead 


Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side

All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em, ""When you find true love, it lives on""
Ah, that's why I stay here


And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead 


Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight


Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushin' me
But I can feel you touchin' me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Tellin' me I'm fine


Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side 
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight


Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha

Lana Del Rey,​hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it,"I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not


I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have


I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past


There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off


I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have"
Lana Del Rey,National Anthem,"

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?


I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" 


Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact 


I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?



Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem


It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon


Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem


Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Lana Del Rey,Heroin,"Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can, sometimes, make it hard to dream


Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear


I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everythin' and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again and tell me everything's okay

Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here

Takin' all my medicine to take my thoughts away

I hope that I come back one day to tell you that I really changed

 Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy

Ask you if you want somethin' to eat
Drive around, get drunk, do it over again
Wake you up at night, quarter to one
I can never stop, wanna have fun
Don't be actin' like I'm the kinda girl who can sleep


'Cause every time you say you're gonna go
I just smile, 'cause, babe, I already know
You know I got nothin' under this overcoat

Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again


Pick you up around quarter to two
Usually we got nothin' to do
Screw it, maybe you should go and record some of your songs
Got my dress on tight 'cause you know that I
Look shinin' in the light, therе's so much ridin'
On this life and how we write a lovе song

Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again


'Cause I love to love, to love, to love you
I hate to hate, to hate, to hate you
Put the Beatles on, light the candles, go back to bed
'Cause I wanna, wanna, wanna want you
I need to, need to, need to need you
Put the TV on, the flowers in a vase, lie your head


Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and me, back at it again"

Serving Coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me


I can be your one time baby

You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him


I can be your one time baby

Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know, if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Lana Del Rey,Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd,"Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard?
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel somewhat like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty sealed up by two man-made walls


And I'm like
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?


Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Therе's a tunnel under Ocean Boulеvard


There's a girl who sings ""Hotel California""
Not because she loves the notes or sounds that sound like Florida
It's because she's in a world, preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors, running down the corridor


Oh, man
When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?

Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard


Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says ""Don't forget me"" makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me five
Lennon in my back, whisperin' in my ear
""Come on, baby, you can thrive""
But I can't


When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?


Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard 

Yeah, oh
Don't forget me, don't forget me
No, don't, don't forget me
Don't you, don't you forget me

Lana Del Rey,A&W,"

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?


I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter


Call him up, ""Come into my bedroom""
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore


Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter


Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head, but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore


I mean, look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this , so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore 
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

Singing blues has been gettin' old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold


Don't break me down 
I been traveling too long 
I been tryin' too hard 
With one pretty song 


I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind


So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark


Don't leave me now 
Don't say goodbye 
Don't turn around 
Leave me high and dry 


I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind


I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride


I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I

But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather


But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool

Cold heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too

For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

Boy, look at you lookin' at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real


All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye-bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye-bye


Boy, look at you lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye-bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye-bye


Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

Lana Del Rey,The greatest,"I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo


Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall


And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all




I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When‚ baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all

The culture is lit, and if this is it‚ I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all


I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all

If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames‚ it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone

Lana Del Rey,Norman fucking Rockwell,"Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said ""I love you""
You're fun and you’re wild

Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah


'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue


Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you

Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

Lana Del Rey,Off to the Races,"My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny, the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart


Swimmin' pool, glimmering darlin'
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool, bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, yeah


Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins


And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone


Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him


Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""


And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love


You are my one true love"

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon


You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing


No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
""Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want""
It's innocence lost, innocence lost


In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, ""Baby, that's alright with me""


No one's gonna take my soul away

When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy

Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons

And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah 


Darlin', darlin', darlin'

Set on fire by fiends 
And all my black beaches 
Are ruined 
My celluloid scenes 
Are torn at the seams 
And I fall to pieces 
 I fall to pieces when I'm with you


 'Cause I love you so much 
I fall to pieces

And all of my peaches are ruined 
Are ruined , are ruined "
Lana Del Rey,Ride Monologue,"I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times
I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me



Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
""I believe in the kindness of strangers""
And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free"

Lana Del Rey,Get Free,"Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts


This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us who never got the chance
For and for 
And all my birds of paradise 
Who never got to fly at night 
'Cause they were caught up in the dance


Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black  into the blue 


Finally, gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was, I was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them 
There's nothing to hold on to 
The colors used to lure you in 
And put you in a trance 


Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black  into the blue 


Out of the black  into the blue 
Out of the black  into the blue

Lana Del Rey,Florida Kilos,"White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that, you already know



Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side


Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo


Sun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby, like you like your drinks: cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we’re not in



Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side


Yayo, yayo, yayo

We could get high in Miami, ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami, ooh, ooh

Lana Del Rey,Cola,"My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise


Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy

All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby


Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side


Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah


I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy

All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby


Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side


Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on



Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, ahh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, oh yeah"
Lana Del Rey,Mariners Apartment Complex,"You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been


And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in


You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man


They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man, yeah


You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man


Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?"
Lana Del Rey,Fuck it I love you,"I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
""Maybe  I'll do it differently""


So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly


Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do


I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly


Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do


It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time

It's killing me slowly


Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you 
I really do 


California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Jazz in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Jazz in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Jazz in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Jazz in my veins, running out of time"
Lana Del Rey,13 Beaches,"I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape


It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera-ready
Almost all the time


But I still get lonely and, baby, only then
Do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line


It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine


But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line


It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real


It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal"
Lana Del Rey,Margaret,"This is a simple song, gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on a rooftop, she was wearin' white
And he was like, ""I might be in trouble""
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
""Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?""


'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble


When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know


Word to all my friends
With their rеd flags, their white knights
Their black еyes and their blue lies
If you're askin' yourself, ""How do you know?""
Then that's your answer, the answer is ""No""
You gotta run, gotta run, run, run, run like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire

'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble


When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me
The diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
The one that makes me sing
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know


So if you don't know, don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring


Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
I mean, join the party
By the way, the party is December 18


'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me
That diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
The one that makes me sing
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know"
