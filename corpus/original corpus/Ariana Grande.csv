Ariana Grande,​nasty,"This bitch gon' make me...


You got me all up in my feels, in all kind of ways
I be tryna wait, but, lately, I just wanna keep it real 
No more playin' safe, let's take it all the way
I'm just sayin'


I just wanna make time for ya 
Swear it's just right for ya
Like this pussy designed for ya 
Ten outta five on ya
Know I would sign on the line for ya 
Bet I look nice on you 
Open my mind for ya 


Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for?
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get 
Tonight, I wanna get 

Promise I'ma give it to you like you never had it
I do it so good, it's gon' be hard to break the habit
You're like a whole constellation 
Swimming like you on vacation 
Promise I'm still gonna love you when you wake up in the AM


I just wanna make time for ya
Swear it's just right for ya
Like this pussy designed for ya
Ten outta five on ya
Know I would sign on the line for ya
Bet I look nice on you 
Open my mind for ya 


Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 

Boy, you know the vibes, I don't waste no time
Take what's on your mind, make it real life
Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feelin' inside
So much conversation, words so sweet
Been so well-behaved, but, boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth


Don't wanna wait on it 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 

Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Yeah"

Ariana Grande,34+35,"Hmm


You might think I'm crazy
The way I've been cravin'
If I put it quite plainly
Just gimme them babies
So what you doin' tonight?
Better say, ""Doin' you right"" 
Watchin' movies, but we ain't seen a thing tonight 


I don't wanna keep you up 
But show me, can you keep it up? 
'Cause then I'll have to keep you up
Shit, maybe I'ma keep you up, boy
I've been drinkin' coffee 
And I've been eatin' healthy 
You know I keep it squeaky, yeah 
Savin' up my energy 


Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five 
Can you stay up all night? 
Fuck me 'til the daylight
Thirty-four, thirty-five 

You drink it just likе water 
You say it tastes likе candy

Oh yeah, yeah
Baby, you might need a seat belt when I ride it
I'ma leave it open like a door, come inside it
Even though I'm wifey, you can hit it like a side chick
Don't need no side dick, no
Got the neighbors yellin', ""Earthquake!"" 
4.5 when I make the bed shake 
Put it down heavy even though it's lightweight 
We started at midnight
Go 'til the sunrise 
Done at the same time 
But who's countin' the time when we got it for life? 
I know all your favorite spots 
We can take it from the top 
You such a dream come true, true
Make a bitch wanna hit snooze, ooh

Can you stay up all night?
Fuck me 'til the daylight 
Thirty-four, thirty-five 
Can you stay up all night? 
Fuck me 'til the daylight 
Thirty-four, thirty-five 


Means I wanna ""69"" with you
No shit
Math class
Never was good"
Ariana Grande,​better off,"You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah


Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional , yeah


I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya


Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition, I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah


I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya 


I'm better off without him

Ariana Grande,​just like magic,"Oh, yeah


Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day 
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote 


Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven


Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 


Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it 
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected 
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light 

Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven


Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it 
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it


I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits
Just like magic , just like magic


Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 


Mmm, mmm 
Mmm-oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah, mmm"
Ariana Grande,​imagine,"Step up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, ""Skrrt""
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep 'til noon
Me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never
Act this regular


Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes


Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world


Knew you were perfect after the first kiss
Took a deep breath like, ""Ooh""
Feels like forever, baby, I never
Thought that it would be you
Tell me your secrets, all of the creep shit
That's how I know it's true
Baby, direct it, name in the credits
Like the movies do

Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes


Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I'm 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world


Can you imagine it?
Can you imagine it?

Ariana Grande,Best Mistake,"How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?


Break up, make up, total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? 
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you


'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on , mm, hold on, ayy 

I guess time's wasting
Tick-tockin', lip lockin'
How can we keep the feelings fresh? How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets 
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up , I know love can be a beach with no shore 
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four 
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest  couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just bein' honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Break up, make up 
Total waste of time 
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we're blind? 
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you


'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, ayy


You , you , you , you 
Mm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

You , you , you , you 


Mm, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

After laughter comes tears


Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving

If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far

If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

After what I been through, I can’t lie

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above

I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time 
Look at the cards that we've been dealt

Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell 


Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good

A whole lot of baggage

Don't want that living in your head

Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net

Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl 
It's timе for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry storе and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts

Ariana Grande,"​thank u, next","Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel


One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say


Thank you, next

Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 


She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 


I've got so much love 
Got so much patience 
And I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see

And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's, baby boo, so don't be dumb

Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it "

Ooh-ooh, oh 


A few weeks ago
I saw you front row
And my heart stopped at the sight 
Thought you were solo 
But you got a girl though 
And my life ain't been the same
Been feelin'


Mentally, physically weak 
Boys blowin' up my phone 
They just ain't you, oh, baby
I'm meant to be on my own 
But just before I go 
There's something you should know
And boy, I


I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five
Five-to-nine
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of  way 
That just ain't me

A few months later
You're still togеther 
And you just can't tell mе why 
So, boy, stop pretendin' 
'Cause I won't keep waitin'
I'm out the door, bye, bye, bye 
Been feelin'


Mentally, physically weak  
Boys blowin' up my phone  
They just ain't you, oh, baby

There's something you should know

Ariana Grande,​in my head,"Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​


Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me


My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel


Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 


Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm

Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me


My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel , Abel , Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able


Falling, falling, boy, I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one

Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm


Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

Thought you were somebody else, you 
Thought you were somebody else, you"
Ariana Grande,Dangerous Woman,"Oh, yeah


Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open


All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy


Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout


Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy 


Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't

Ariana Grande,NASA,"This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind


I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight


Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A


Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 

Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm


Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A


Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 


You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover

Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year


Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's


True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy


Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year


I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy


Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year


Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here

Oh, woah


Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if you're really there
