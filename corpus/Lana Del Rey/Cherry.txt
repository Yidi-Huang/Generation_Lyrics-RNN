Love , I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger 
'Cause you just want it so much


A touch , from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil 
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah 


Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries  and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined


Love , is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya 
And you just stay lined up, yeah 


Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces 
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches 
Are ruined 

My rose garden dreams 
Set on fire by fiends 
And all my black beaches 
Are ruined 
My celluloid scenes 
Are torn at the seams 
And I fall to pieces 
 I fall to pieces when I'm with you


 'Cause I love you so much 
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme 
And all of my peaches are ruined 
Are ruined , are ruined
