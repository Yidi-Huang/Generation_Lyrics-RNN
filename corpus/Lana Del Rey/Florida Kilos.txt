White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that, you already know



Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side


Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo


Sun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby, like you like your drinks: cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter weâ€™re not in



Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side


Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo



We could get high in Miami, ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami, ooh, ooh
That's what they all say yay


Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison don't mean nothing to me if you'll be by my side


Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Floridians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Colombians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all my girlfriends
Yayo, yayo, yayo


That's how we do it, like
Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance the night away
