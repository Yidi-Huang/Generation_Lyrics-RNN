It started with a kiss
On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true
I guess I thought you was, yeah


Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah


I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you


Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
You might also like
Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky
Shouldn't have did you wrong (Woah)
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone


Why did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (Everything)
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late (Gettin' late)
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah


I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
(You said it too, baby)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (Ooh)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you


Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away, yeah


I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
(Found someone new)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Believe it, baby)


Baby, no, oh, cheating on you (I said goodbye, but I'm still in love)
Baby, no (I said goodbye, but I'm still in love)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you


I said goodbye
And you said goodbye
