Tell me how you like it rough
Love it when I pull your hair, baby
I wanna see your clothes come off
But please keep on them heels, babe
Don't worry if it get to loud (to loud)
Go ahead, scream and shout, baby
And if you wanna go all night
With you I'll be a nympho


No (I'm not up for loving)
If it's alright (I'm not up for loving)
No one to night (I'm not up for loving)
So I hope you like when I


Take you from the bed to the bathroom floor
I'mma make you scream, make you beg for more
We can have the neighbors at our door
And I can tell them we're not making love
(Looooove)


I know you like it nice and slow (nice and slow)
But, we can save that for round two, baby
And if you wanna play that role
I'll be your superhero, baby
Amazing how you get me off
No kissing, no touching, we're straight to it
There's plenty time for making love
Tonight I'll be your nympho

Tonight I'm back in everything
(Believe me, it's where I go)
Until I feel you're breaking down
(And you can't take no more)
I'll start it on the stairs, take you to the couch
Kitchen countertop, I'mma break you off
Indeed, giving you what you need, when we
