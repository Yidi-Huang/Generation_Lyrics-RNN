I'm still smoking 'cause I read somewhere
If I quit before I'm 26
I'll be fine so I'm lying to myself
While I light another cigarette
I'm addicted to my phone
Getting anxious every time that it's out of reach
I lie awake, screen right up in my face
And I wonder why I can't sleep


Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?


I saw these awful things in a documentary
Decided I would stop eating meat
To save the planet, 'til I was like, "Damnit"
I didn't even last a week
So pretty perfect on the surface, but the truth is
I don't wanna be that guy
But I got a script, better stick to it
My label's telling me I gotta lie


Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?
And nobody's perfect under the surface
They'll never see that side of me
Oh, can you see the irony?
You might also like
I just got a new tattoo, I'm embarrassed
'Cause I didn't even tell my own mom
So every time I'm home visiting my parents
I always keep my sweater on
I donâ€™t care if it's the truth or not
All I care about is gettin' likes
Reading the comments like everybody's honest
When they're cheering for my fake life


Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?
And nobody's perfect under the surface
They'll never see that side of me
Oh, can you see the irony?


'Cause I'm only human after all
Put a filter on and make it look natural
'Cause I'm only human after all
Put a filter on and make it look natural
Can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?


Oh, can you see the irony?
Oh, can you see the irony?
And nobody's perfect under the surface
But everybody's tryna be
Can't you see the irony?

Oh, can you see the irony?
