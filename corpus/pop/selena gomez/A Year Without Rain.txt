Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


Can you feel me when I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute, no matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wanderin' the desert for a thousand days (Oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby


I'm missin' you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Oh-oh
Whoa, whoa


The stars are burnin'
I hear your voice in my mind (Voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me callin'?
My heart is yearning like the ocean that's runnin' dry
Catch me, I'm fallin'
It's like the ground is crumblin' underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby
You might also like
I'm missin' you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (By my side)
Don't know how I'll survive (How I'll survive)
A day without you is like a year without rain
Oh-oh
Whoa, whoa


So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me, baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain
Oh-oh


I'm missin' you so much (So much)
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (By my side)
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh (Whoa)
