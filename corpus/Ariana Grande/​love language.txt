Oh, I know you're probably thinkin', "What's the use?"
I promise it's the little things that you do
That make me wanna give it all to you
You know I do, babe


You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh, babe
Baby
Been a minute since I had somethin' so sweet


If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night


Why would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, somethin' that I can't deny
Lеft my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All minе

You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh, honey
Baby
It's been a minute since I had somethin' so sweet, mm, oh


If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night


Baby, pardon my French, but could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation 'cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy , it's expensive to taste
Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face 


If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night

Head over my shoes like woah
Know you like an inside joke
Runnin' 'cause you're just my speed
'Less you want it in slo-mo 
I'm not what you had before 
Your ex-girlfriend don't want no smoke 
I ain't tryna sign no lease
I'm just gon' make you my home
