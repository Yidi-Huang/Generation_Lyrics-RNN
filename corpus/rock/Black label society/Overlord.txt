This Babylon of fear that you shall know
To rule and suppress, destroy and overthrow

Kings of this world
The servants shall serve, slaves never free
Kings of this world, all that's to be
All that you hear, and all that you see, yeah

I am your overlord, everything above and below
I am your overlord, the exodus of your will
And all that you'll ever know

This brotherhood of snakes shall rule and control
The corruption of man his fate and his soul

Kings of this world
The servants shall serve, slaves never free
Kings of this world, all that's to be
All that you hear, and all that you see, yeah

I am your overlord, everything above and below
I am your overlord, the exodus of your will
And all that you'll ever know

For the slaves shall never see
The apocalyptic end of the past
The new world shall forever be

The great conspiracy, the betrayal of God
The fires of revolution aimed at the Heavens above

Kings of this world
The servants shall serve, slaves never free
Kings of this world, all that's to be
All that you hear, and all that you see, yeah

I am your overlord, everything above and below
I am your overlord, the exodus of your will
And all that you'll ever know

I am your overlord, everything above and below
I am your overlord, the exodus of your will
And all that you'll ever knowEmbed
