Forever born again just to die so quick
The floodgates of the damned shall crash and burn once again
Nuclear obsession; the fall of the weak
Atomic demolition, destroy all you seek
The flood gates of the damned shall crash and burn once again


Down, down, down
Forever down
Down, down, down
Forever down


Terrified reflections that rip through the sky
Apocalyptic birth, the screams and the cries
Floodgates of the damned shall crash and burn once again
The reverend of the grave, the mother of the end
The wings of the bastard, shall spread once again


Down, down, down
Forever down
Down, down, down
Forever down
