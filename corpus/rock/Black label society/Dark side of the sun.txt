On the dark side of the sun
Living just to bury the dead

On the dark side of the sun
On the dark side of the sun

Belief in your words
That you're chosen
The giver and taker are one
The past shall rise from it's ashes
On the dark side of the sun

On the dark side of the sun
On the dark side of the sun

A sea of cries as the mass begins
The gathering has begun
Absolution won't be found
On the dark side of the sun

The manifestation of hatred
Deception upon the blind
On the dark side of the sun
Graves of the innocent
You shall find
You might also likeOn the dark side of the sun
