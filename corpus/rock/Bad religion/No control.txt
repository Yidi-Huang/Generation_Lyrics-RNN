To an inharmonic whole
Consciousness has plagued us, and we cannot shake it
Though we think we're in control
Though we think we're in control


Questions that besiege us in life are testament of our helplessness

There's no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate, it will all happen again, yeah


Time is so rock solid in the minds of the hordes, but they can't
Explain why it should slip away
Explain why it should slip away
History and future are the comforts of our curiosity but here we are
Rooted in the present day
Rooted in the present day


Questions that besiege us in life are testament of our helplessness


There's no vestige of beginning, no prospect of an end
When we all disintegrate, it will all happen again, yeah
If you came to conquer, you'll be king for a day
But you too will deteriorate and quickly fade away


And believe these words you hear when you think your path is clear


We have no control
We have no control
We have no control
We do not understand
You have no control
You are not in command
You have no control
We have no control
No control
No control
