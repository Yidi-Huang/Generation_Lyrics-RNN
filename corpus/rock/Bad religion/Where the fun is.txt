And fashion trips on tangled skein
If you need to slake that aching in your brain

This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is

In the shadow of the valley
Where the nights are warm
We will fear no evil
When we get things done
Tap in into the vein
We'll road trip and raise Cain
Down on the nickel
With a flame in the rain

This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is

So jump in into the frame
We're laughing to hide the pain
It's not a riddle we're all a little, a little amazed

This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun is
This is where the fun isYou might also likeEmbed
