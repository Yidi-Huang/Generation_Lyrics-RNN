When I was young I was invincible
I find myself now thinking twice
I never thought about no future
Its just the roll of the dice


But the day may come when you've got something to lose
And just when you think you're done paying dues
And you say to yourself, dear God what have I done?
And hope it's not too late cause tomorrow may never come

Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come


Yesterday is history and tomorrow's a mystery
But baby right now, it's just about you and me
You can run you can hide, just like Bonnie and Clyde
Reach for the sky ain't never gonna die
And I thank the Lord for the love I have found
And hold you tight cause tomorrow may never come


Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come




So if you please take this moment
Try if you can make it last
Don't think about no future and just forget about the past
And make it last


Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never comeYou might also like
