When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different from when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is, yeah
And when my voice is screamin' out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standin' in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing's a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Movin' forward



A subtle power 
A tough love 
Oh, like a shark 
Ooh, like a bear, a tough love


And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
It couldn't slow us down
And I thought I could live without you
Hey, hey
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

And just like you, I can't be scared
And just like you, I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love 
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky and what falls
It's a superpower 
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together, we got plenty superpower



A subtle power 
A tough love 
Oh, like a shark 
Ooh, too much to bear 


And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldn't slow us down
And I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
And nothing I know couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down 
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down, down
