Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Ivy on me
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta cool down, heated 

I gotta cool it down, heated 
Yeah, yeah 

It's been a lot of years, really think you gettin' one past me? 
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool it down, heated 
You got me heated
Heated, oh


Never met a girl with a mind like this, no, no
To give you space and timе like this, my love
Nevеr met a girl so fine like this, no, no, no, no, no
With a waist that wine like this, my love


Only a real one could tame me
Only the radio could play me 
Oh, now you wish I was complacent 
Boy, you musta mixed up our faces 
Oh, now you wanna have conversations 
See, now you're testin' my patience 
Yeah, yeah 

Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Chanel on me
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta cool down, heated 

I gotta cool it down, heated 

Got a lot of style, got a lot of Tiffany on me
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool it down, heated 
You got me heated 
Heated, oh 


Whole lotta reservations, whole lotta
Whole lotta textin' with no conversations 
Whole lotta playin' victim and a villain at the same time
Whole lotta, huh, money, not a lot of patience
Whole lotta niggas been waitin'
They want some time on it, now I wanna flaunt it
Panty and a bra, we can get involved, boy 
If you keep playin' with my heart, boy
I'm just as petty as you are 

Uh, only a real man can tame me
Only the radio could play me
Only my baby 


Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Chanel on me
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta fan myself off 
I gotta cool down, heated 

I gotta cool it down, heated
Heated


Never met a girl with a mind like this, no, no
To give you the space at a time like this, my love 
Never met a girl so fine like this, no, no, no, no, no 
With a waist that wine like this 


Tip, tip, tip on hardwood floors
Ten, ten, ten across the board 
Give me face, face, face, face, yah
Your face card never declines, my God 
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Mm, yummy, yummy, yum, make the bummy heated
Make a pretty girl talk that shitty
Whiskey 'til I'm tipsy, glitter on my kitty 
Cool it down, down, down, my pretty
Bad, bad bitchy make the bad bitch glitchy
Fine, fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine, fine
Liberated, livin' like we ain't got time
Yadda, yadda, yah, yadda, yadda, yah, yah
Yadda, yadda, yadda, bom, bom, ka, ka
Blastin' on that ass, blast on that ass
Fan me quick, girl, I need my glass
Fan me off, my wrist goes click
Dimples on my hip, stretch marks on my tits
Drinkin' my water, mindin' my biz
Monday, I'm overrated, Tuesday, on my dick
Flip-flop, flippy, flip-floppin'-ass bitch
Fan me off, watch my wrist go click
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Cuff me, please, 'cause this ain't fair
Dripped in my pearls like Coco Chanel
Uncle Jonny made my dress
That cheap Spandex, she looks a mess
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Fingertips go tap, tap, t-tap
On my MPC, makin' disco trap
Uncle Jonny made my dress
That cheap Spandex, she looks a mess
