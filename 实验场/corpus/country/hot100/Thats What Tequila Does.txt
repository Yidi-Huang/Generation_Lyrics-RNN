It don't take too much
To get the wheels turnin' round and round in my head
Top shelf or Cuervo
I know it's gonna stir up every memory she left
Still burns, I can't lie
When I think about the good before goodbye
Guess that's what I'm drinkin' on tonight


It'll make you think that you got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back and that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you thinking 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does


It sneaks up on you
Goin' out for one turns into 2AM
You know what's next, get you lookin' for a text
Get you checkin' your phone again
Make you stay all night, it'll give you a million reasons why


It'll make you think that you got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back and that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you thinking 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Yeah, that's what tequila does
Oh, woah, oh, oh

It'll make you think that you got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back and that's what makes you stay for another round

Until she's all you thinking 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Yeah, that's what tequila does
Oh, woah, oh, ohEmbed
