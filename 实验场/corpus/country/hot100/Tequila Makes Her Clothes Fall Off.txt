She said, "I'm going out with my girlfriends
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn"
Oh, have mercy, my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off


I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patr√≥n
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off


She'll start by kickin' out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink


Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off (Whoa-oh)


She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jell-O shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off
You might also like
She'll start by kickin' out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink


She don't mean nothin'
She's just havin' fun
Tomorrow she'll say, "Oh, what have I done?"
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, tequila makes her clothes fall offEmbed
