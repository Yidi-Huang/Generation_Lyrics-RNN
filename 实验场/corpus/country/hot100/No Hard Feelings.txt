I took a little time, tequila and therapy
And threw it in a blender with ice
I was more messed up than I cared to be
Spent a whole lot of lonely nights

I was mad at myself, pissed at the world
It was hard to get up, but I put one foot
In front of the other, kept on keepin' on
Going through the motions until


There was no hard feelings
And no bad vibes
I can honestly say
I'm happy to see the happy back in your eyes
You found somebody
Who painted your grey skies blue
Do I wish it was me? Hell yeah
Am I all the way over thе pain? Not yet
But the sun keeps coming up, baby
And I'm still breathing
And thеre's no hard feelings


Well, I probably owe you an apology
And some money for a new screen door
Your dad's probably glad to be rid of me
But that ain't me anymore
You might also likeHey, you love who you love
And you lose who you thought was the one
And you think that you might go crazy
And never get out of the rut
You get drunk, you hold on and let go of the grudge, 'till


There's no hard feelings
And no bad vibes
I can honestly say
I'm happy to see the happy back in your eyes
You found somebody
Who painted your grey skies blue
But do I wish it was me? Hell yeah
Am I all the way over the pain? Not yet
But the sun keeps coming up, baby
And I'm still breathing
And there's no hard feelings


I was mad at myself, pissed at the world
It was hard to get up, but I put one foot in
In front of the other, kept on keeping' on
Going through the motions until


There was no hard feelings
And no bad vibes
I can honestly say
I'm happy to see a little happy back in your eyes
You found somebody
Who painted your grey skies blue, good for you
But do I wish it was me? Hell yeah
Am I all the way over the pain? Not yet
But the sun keeps coming up, baby
And I'm still breathing
And there's no hard feelings
I got no hard feelingsEmbed
