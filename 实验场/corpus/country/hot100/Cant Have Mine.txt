You can find you a girl on a Friday night
Dancing in the back of a bar
On Sunday morning, hands up high
Singing front row in the choir
You can find you a girl through a friend of a friend
She could show up right out of the blue
It don't matter where you find her
Just as long as you


Find you a girl that leaves you speechless
Gets wild on the town but still loves Jesus
One who's worth the wait even when she ain't on time
Find you a girl that loves her daddy
Talking 'bout babies makes her happy
Yeah take it from me that's the kind you need to find
You just can't have mine


Find you a girl that likes to do all the things you love to do
And even on your worst day
She still thinks you hung thе moon
Find you a girl that's like fine wine
It just gеts better with age
Boy you're heaven made
You might also like
If you find you a girl that leaves you speechless
Gets wild on the town but still loves Jesus
One who's worth the wait even when she ain't on time
Find you a girl that loves her daddy
Talking 'bout babies makes her happy
Yeah take it from me that's the kind you need to find
You just can't have mine


Thank God she loves me
God knows I got so lucky
If you want one like I got
You gotta trust me


And find you a girl that leaves you speechless
Gets wild on the town but still loves Jesus
One who's worth the wait even when she ain't on time
Find you a girl that loves her daddy
Talking 'bout babies makes her happy
Yeah take it from me that's the kind you need to find
You just can't have mine
No you can't have mine
