I'm cleaning up them dirty words that I say, these days
Showing up to church a lot more on Sunday
I'm working on bad habit breaking
Cutting back on Copenhagen
Little less gas, little more brake in my Chevrolet
Whatever it takes 'cause
I got a gift from God sitting in the backseat
And I'ma need to be a little better if he's gonna wanna be like me


I'm just a good ol' boy
Trying to be a good ol' man
Out here learning on the fly
Trying to do the best I can
To raise 'em up right
No Sir, yes Ma'am
I'm just a good ol' boy
Trying to be a good ol' man
Yes I am
Mh yeah


We're gonna be a lot of learning in between them inches on that door frame
I don't know a lot about a lot but I know I can teach him a few thing
How to swim, how to fish, how to drive a stick
Just like my daddy taught me
And he'll know how to say he's sorry
'Cause he'll hear that from me

Oh I'm trying, oh I'm trying, oh I'm trying, oh I'm trying to be a good ol' man


Making a man outta him
Is making a man outta me
Making a man outta him
So one day he'll be
Another good ol' boy
