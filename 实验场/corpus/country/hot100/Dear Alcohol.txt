I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
And I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted


Repeat the cycle every day, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes
Alcohol ain't my friend, but I keep drinkin' 'cause these demons roam
And follow me 'round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it turns my heart cold
But I keep drinkin' 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm havin' problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Lookin' at this bottle, havin' nothin' but doubt
Don't wanna drink, but it keeps comin' around and around and around

I know I need to quit (I need to quit)
I gotta do better (I gotta do better)
Example to these kids (Example to these kids)
'Cause they watchin' when I'm in there, but I'm scared
'Cause I've been chasin' the man that I am when I start to drink
He's cocky, confident and he don't give a damn what you think
This world is beatin' me down, it has pushed me right to the brink
I take a shot every time because man it helps me escape
I'm takin' care of these people, but no one takes care of me
I wanna talk to somebody, but I feel no one relates
I need better now, I think I've lost my way
I'm havin' battles with faith, it's painted right on my face
I hope better times are comin', no chase but I'm still runnin'
I gotta take control, and I won't stop for nothin'
Dear God, this is my test, promise that I'll do my best
Just help me with this pain I feel and pressure that is on my chest

I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
I got wasted 'cause I didn't wanna deal with myself tonight
My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize
I got wasted
