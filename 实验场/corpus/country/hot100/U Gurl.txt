Well, sit out there on that porch swing
Don't phase you that it's pourin' rain
And I kinda like that you ain't afraid to get mud on your boots (Okay)
Get sideways of that George Strait
Keep backin' up that tailgate
Trucker hat
Hundred proof


Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woah-woo girl
Southern flowin' through girl
Do what you do, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl


Said the way you walk is suggestive
Strip mall town impressive
Girl, I hate to see you go (Hold up)
But I love to watch you exit
All flames, where you cookin' that?
That bourbon kiss, where you puttin' that?
I know it's rude to stare but shoot
You might also like
I don't wanna stop lookin' at you, girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woah-woo, girl
Southern flowin' through girl
Do what you do, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl


Babe
Brown eyes like two hurricanes
Lasso me, well I hope it rains
Movin' me with the way you move


Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woah-woo girl
Southern flowin' through girl
Do what you do, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you, girl
