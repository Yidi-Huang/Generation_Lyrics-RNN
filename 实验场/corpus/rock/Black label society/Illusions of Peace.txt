Zero horizons, once chosen miles


Upon these wings
This flight of greed
Walk with me, your new beginning
Religion and creed
The eternal voice
Beyond this door
Illusions of peace
Now and forever more


Your wounds of loss, I shall heal and bear
Where nothing matters and nothing ends


Upon these wings
This flight of greed
Walk with me, your new beginning
Religion and creed
The eternal voice
Beyond this door
Illusions of peace
Now and forever more
