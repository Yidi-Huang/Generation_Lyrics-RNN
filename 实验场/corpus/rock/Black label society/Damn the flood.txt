The breeding lies
Existence of unjust
Spewing falsehoods as they crawl
Assassins of one's trust


First you slither
Then you crawl
Damn the flood
I've come to end it all


Poisened blood manipulates
The bending of one's will
Assassins of your sacred words
For trust it shall be killed


First you slither
Then you crawl
Damn the flood
I've come to end it all

First you slither
Then you crawl
I've come to damn the flood
And end it all
You might also like


First you slither
Then you crawl
Damn the flood
I've come to end it all

First you slither
Then you crawl
I've come to damn the flood
And end it allEmbed
