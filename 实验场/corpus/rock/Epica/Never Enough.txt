Voices you can't hear
Because you are consumed and incontent
With everlasting greed

Don't you see me on my hands and knees?
Begging and bleeding
You're smiling as you bite the hand that feeds
But will you never see?

Always wanting what your eyes can't see
Needing what your arms can't reach
Thinking you are in need
Always hearing what your ears can't hear
Feeling what your hands can't touch
Thinking you are incomplete
(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through
(Never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
This is where I will draw the line!

Sacrificed my life to be with you
Why did you leave me?
There's nothing more from me you can consume
Cause you are incomplete

Always wanting what your eyes can't see
Needing what your arms can't reach
Thinking you are in need
Always hearing what your ears can't hear
Feeling what your hands can't touch
Thinking you are incomplete

(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through
(Never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
This is where I will draw the line!

Would you please answer me?
And make me complete
Everlasting greed
Would you please set me free?
Fulfill all my needs
And make me complete

(Enough)
It was
Never enough that I gave to you
All of the horror that you've put me through
(Never enough)
How can I make up my mind this time?
This is where I will draw the line!

Never again will I be with you
No promise eternal carrying us through
I finally made up my mind this time
This is the end
I've drawn the line!

Never enough to devour your greed!Embed
