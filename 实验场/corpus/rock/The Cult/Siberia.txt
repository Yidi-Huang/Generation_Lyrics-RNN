Licking honey off the knife
Caught me where I snap
The pound is killing flow
And I need you more than truth
Siberia, those are like your tears
Keep me closer, surrender forever
The love that you find is the love that I give
Fishes in despite
With lightening in your eye
Dressed in gravel clothes
They tear my heart once more
I need you, all of you
Siberia, those are like your tears
Keep me closer, surrender forever
The love that you find is the love, the love that I give
Surrender forever
Which its tears are melting
The ships are on fire
Never making out alive
Southern heal, boats are right like your tears
Let me closer, surrender forever
Love that you find is the love that I give
Siberia, those are like your tears
Keep me close, surrender forever
Never make it out aliveYou might also likeEmbed
