Fearless on my final quest
Find truth beyond the flesh
Fleeting past my dreams
Of unfulfilled desire
My strength unwavering
My journey just beginning
A desperate race
Through the corridors of hell


Chaos emerges
Surrender, I will not


The last enemy is falling (Is falling)
Here I am
To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling (Is falling)
Here I stand
To conquer death itself


Funeral silence
Beneath the burning cross
My immortal soul
Sleeps with the wolves tonight
Skin and bones that rot
My blood runs dry
See me die
To rise with the gods again
You might also like
Chaos emerges
Surrender, I will not


The last enemy is falling (Is falling)
Here I am
To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling (Is falling)
Here I stand
To conquer death itself




Defy
Decay
Arise
Again




Chaos emerges
Surrender, I will not
(Not, not, not)

The last enemy is falling (Is falling)
Here I am
To conquer death itself
The last enemy is falling (Is falling)
Here I stand
To conquer death itselfEmbed
