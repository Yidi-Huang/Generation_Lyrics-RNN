I pick the fight against the tide
Free at last, I go my own way
I will resist them, till the day I die


I am who I am
My time has come


I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come


There is no sacred place, no perfect world
Your head is home, freedom in your heart
Be strong, take this chance
Make your way, a better future calls


I am who I am
My time has come
You might also like
I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come


No gods, no masters
No gods, no masters


What doesnâ€™t kill us, makes us stronger
Locked and loaded, ready to strike
Here we stand, loud and proud
United as one, united as one


I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come


I am who I am
Take it or leave it
A rebel at heart
No gods, no masters
My time has come
