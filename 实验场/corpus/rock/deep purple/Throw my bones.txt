I don't know what lies ahead
It's all a mystery man, I heard it said
You do your thing, you do your best
I take a guess at what happen next


All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?

I hear the future is so divine
But I'll just wait until I get a sign
'Cause what I've got here, what I'm holding in my hand
Is better for me than some promised land


All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?




What's the rush? Who's to say?
You can't escape tomorrow, it's another day
I'm hanging here, I'm here on solid ground
'Cause heaven's full, or closing down


All I've got is what I need
And that's enough, as far as I can see
Why should I walk into the great unknown
When I can sit here, and throw my bones?
Oh yeah
