It's dangerous, no fear
What she wants I got right here
I'll bite 'n' howl and tear her to bits
She's the one to scratch my itch
Oh yeah she's my pill she's my fix

Give me one more night
Heartbreaker
Down on your knees
Heartbreaker
Just one more night
Heartbreaker
Is all that I need
Give me one more night
Heartbreaker
Down on your knees
Just one more night
Heartbreaker
Is all that I need heartbreaker al' right

Lone walk, long stroll
So what, it's bought and sold
Ten to one, no chance
I took the odds for the Devil's dance
I sealed the deal and she said "yes"
So I put my hands right up her dress
And she said, "What's been taking you so long?"
