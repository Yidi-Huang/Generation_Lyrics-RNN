She's hot and innocent, But she's in demand
She's on the mind of every red-blooded man

She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
When your cruising the beat, You got nothing on your mind
And a girl on the street, She catches your eye
She got hot red lips, With angel's eyes
Swingin' her hips, From side to side
She's hot and innocent, But she's in demand
She's on the mind of every red-blooded man

She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell

Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell

Out on the city, Its late at night
She's so pretty, In the moon so bright
Well you walk into a bar, And the band is playing loud
You're rocking so hard, And so is the crowd
She's hot and innocent, But she's in demand
She's on the mind of every red-blooded man

She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
She's Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
Hotter than Hell
