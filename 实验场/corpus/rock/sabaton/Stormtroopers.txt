Now there's a standstill in the war
Repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end
A few will transcend

They were under twenty five
And under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born
Their enemies scorn


A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born


Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers rise


Jägers led the way
The pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained
Advancement sustained
You might also likeLead through direct command
As they're advancing through the land
Encircling their flanks
And ravage their ranks


Expose their reinforcements, destroying their lines
New doctrine in combat aligns
Infantry attacks, exposing the cracks
New combat ideals, on the Kaiserschlacht's fields


Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches, the Stormtroopers rise
