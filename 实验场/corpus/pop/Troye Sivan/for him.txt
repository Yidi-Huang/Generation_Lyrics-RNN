We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack
You make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump-starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clich√©s on our own little tour
Let's ride

You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you


We try staying up late
But we both are lightweights
Yeah, we get off our face too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart


You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you


Eat a pill, stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honour
You might also like
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you
