It's Britney, bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you


Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection (Oh-oh-oh)
Feels like no one else in the room (But you)

We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying


Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (Mo')
Gimme, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (Mo')
Gimme, gimme (More)


The center of attention (Do you feel that?)
Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (Yeah)
If you're on a mission (Uh-huh), you got my permission (Oh)
You might also like
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rocking (Keep on rocking)
We keep on rocking (Oh), rocking (Uh-huh)
Cameras are flashing
While we're dirty dancing
They keep watching (They keep watching)
Keep watching, feels like the crowd is saying


Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (Mo')
Gimme, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (Mo')
Gimme, gimme (More)


Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh (I just can't)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Control myself)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (More)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (They want more?)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Well, I'll give them more)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Ow! More)

Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (More)
Gimme, gimme (More), give me more
Gimme, gimme (More). gimme (Mo')
Gimme, gimme (More), ooh-ooh
Gimme, gimme (More), gimme (More)
