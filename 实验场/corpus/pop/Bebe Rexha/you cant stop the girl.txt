Oh, they're tryna shoot down angels
They're tryna pull their wings off
So they can't fly
And, oh, but she's so brave, though
Just like a tornado
She's taking us by storm


You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh

You can't stop the girl


They're tryna take our voices
They're tryna make our choices
So we scream loud, loud, loud
And, oh, I know you feel the lightnin'
And it's so excitin'
So, here we come


You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh
You can't stop the girl from going
You can't stop the world from knowing
The truth will set you free, oh


You can't stop the girl
You can't stop the girl
You can't stop the girl
No, you can't stop the girl


Oh, I know you feel the lightnin'
And it's so excitin'
So, here we come
