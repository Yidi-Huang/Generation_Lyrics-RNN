They weigh me down, feels like I'm drowning
I'm tired of my flaws
They feel me with anxiety and doubt


Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And trying to be like everybody else


I wanna be like, look like the girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like no one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me, the girl in the mirror

The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror


I'm sick of the likes and followers everyone's counting
I'm sick of the lies, smiling, but I'm crying inside


Honestly, I'm done with hating pictures of myself
And trying to be like everybody else


I wanna be like, look like the girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like no one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me, the girl in the mirror


The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror


Wanna wake up, no make-up
And still think I'm beautiful
Wanna smile like I mean it
And finally be comfortable with me
Finally be comfortable with me, oh
You might also like
I wanna be like, look like the girl in the mirror
Wanna act like, dance like no one's watching her
I could try to be just like you
But I wanna be like me, the girl in the mirror


The girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
