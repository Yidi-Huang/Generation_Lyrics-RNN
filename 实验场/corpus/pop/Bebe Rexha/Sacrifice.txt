Middle of the night, I'm the only star you'll see
I'ma need those hands runnin' over me
'Cause I ain't that type, to let you go easy, so


Say goodbye
To every other girl in the night behind you
Now you're mine
Tell me what you're willin' to sacrifice, ooh

Sacrifice
When it comes to me, don't want no compromise
This should be the only body on your mind
When it comes to me, I'm down for life
So tell me what you'll sacrifice


Sacrifice
Tell mе what you'll sacrifice
Sacrifice
Tell mе what you'll sacrifice


I wanna be the air every time you breathe
Runnin' through your veins and the spaces in between
I wanna feel your heart every time it bleeds
Livin' in your brain, there's only room for me, so


Say goodbye
To every other girl in the night behind you
Now you're mine
Tell me what you're willin' to sacrifice, ooh


Sacrifice
When it comes to me, don't want no compromise
This should be the only body on your mind
When it comes to me, I'm down for life
So tell me what you'll sacrifice
You might also like
Sacrifice
Tell me what you'll sacrifice
Sacrifice
Tell me what you'll sacrifice


Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
To the rhythm, to the rhythm of mine
Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
To the rhythm, to the rhythm of mine
Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
To the rhythm, to the rhythm of mine
Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
So tell me what you'll sacrifice
