All I need is one
One more man is enough
Babe, you got it wrong
Please turn your fears into trust, to trust


Where did love go?
When all is said and done?
Hey now, put your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
Put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I never met a girl I could trust


You're sayin' those words like you hate me now (Wo-woah)
Our house is burning when you're raisin' hell (Wo-woah)
Here in the ashes, your soul cries out (Ah-ah-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds


These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no
You might also like
All I need is love (Da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is a word (Da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is us (Da-dum, dum, dum)
You turn nouns into verbs (Ooh, oh), to verbs (Ooh, oh)

But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds


These thunderclouds, oh no

These thunderclouds (Oh, whoa, oh)
These thunderclouds (Ah-ah-ah)
These thunderclouds (Oh)
