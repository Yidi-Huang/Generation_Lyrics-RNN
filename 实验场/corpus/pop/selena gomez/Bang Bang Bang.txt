Yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, oh


My new boy used to be a model
He looks way better than you, he looks way better than you
My new boy gets it, how to get me
His love is deeper, you know, he's a real keeper, you know, oh


Bang, bang, bang, I'm breaking in
Stealing all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang, bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that 'til I let him in


You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one that's moping
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one
When I'm out having fun, you’re gonna be the one that's broken


My new boy knows the way I want it
He's got more swagger than you, he's got more swagger than you do
My new boy really likes to flaunt this
He's not hiding me, you know, he's showing me off, you know, oh
