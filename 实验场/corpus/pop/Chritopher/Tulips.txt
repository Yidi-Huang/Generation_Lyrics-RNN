First let me start by saying I'm sorry
I'll make it up to you, don't you worry about it
Girl, I'm gonna give you just what you like
Girl, I'm gonna give you just what you like
I'm not afraid to show you I love you
I'm not afraid to show you and tell everybody
That I'm gonna give you just what you like
Yeah, I'm gonna give you just what you like


Girl, lean back
Why don't you relax?


I wanna kiss your tulips
You got me feeling, got me feeling scandalous
The way your flower blooms for me is dangers
With your pink crush velvet touch
I can't get enough
Girl, you know I love tulips


My appetite is craving your body
I'm hungry for your love, baby
You are my diet
Really, really, really wanna take a bite
Really, really, really wanna take a bite
