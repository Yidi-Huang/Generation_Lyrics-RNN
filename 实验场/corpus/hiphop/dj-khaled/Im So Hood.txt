I represent the ghetto across the world
If you represent the hood, two hands in the sky
I'm so (Hood)
Listen


Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is planning to hate (I'm so hood)
And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you'll know what I'm talking 'bout, I'm out the (Hood)
And if you feel me, put your hands up (Hood)
My hood niggas, can you stand up? (I'm so hood)
If you not from here, you can walk it out (Walk it out)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talking 'bout (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm)


Everybody wanna motherfuckin' know why
I dress so fly, sit so high
Bitch, I do it for the hood (For the hood)
Bitch-ass niggas, I do it 'cause I could, ha ('Cause I could, ha)
Heavy starch in my jeans, please (In my jeans, please)
4X in my white tees (In my white tees)
Living life like a G
That's why these bitch-ass niggas wanna fight me
But I ain't gon' play wit 'em
Uh-uh, rather let the AK hit 'em (Fa-fa-fa)
Tough niggas get fucked up and put on ice
For the rest of they life
I'm straight out the hood, bruh (Straight out the hood, bruh)
See, that's who I do it for
And my low class ghetto ass
Just renewed my ghetto pass

Damn my P.O., y'all can tell her I said it
Violate me if she want, gon' have to come catch me
Piss test me all you want, I'ma smoke when I'm ready
Pants hangin' off me now 'cause my pistol heavy (Hood)
I ain't spoke to you yet, dog, 'cause I ain't friendly
I drink 'Gnac, homie, y'all drink Crist'
I like bust-it babies, I don't want that bougie bitch
I'd never buy a Phantom, twenty-eights can't fit
They say I'm fed bound, they call me high risk
I'm a full-blooded goon, lames make me sick
You gettin' three or four birds, where I'm from, we call you rich
I'd like to thank the hood, homie, you taught how to whip
