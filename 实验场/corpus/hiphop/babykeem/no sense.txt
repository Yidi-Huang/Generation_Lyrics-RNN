Are you mad at me? Are you irritated?
'Til I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Why're you showin' off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showin' out when you with your friends, dawg


Don't be showin' out when you with your mans, dawg
Please don't let me catch him on my ends, dawg
It's a thousand ways to misunderstand, dawg
It's a thousand ways that we can make amends, dawg
And you know he only love you when your pants off
I showed you light, I showed you grown man talk
Age differences between us, on our last, dawg
I'm comin' home, why you always on the edge, dawg?


Arе you mad at me? Are you irritated?
I lеt you duck me, then you celebrated
Why're you showin' off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showin' out when you with your friends, dawg

These niggas tryna ride the wave, ride the wave
Makes no sense, dawg, dawg, dawg
These bitches tryna ride my face, ride my face (Yeah, let's go)

Sorry mama, you ain't need to know this
Sorry mama, but I couldn't focus
You ain't gon' have my back against the ropes
You poppin' pussy like that bitch, go then
I'm walkin' down the aisle doin' my Dougie
If I'm walkin' down the aisle, I hope you love me
I like it skinny and I like it chubby
As long as we involved, it won't bug me
Ho, it's your birthday, your birthday
It's your birthday, we gotta take a picture
It's your birthday from now to December
It's a birthday, how could I not remember?
We fuck, so I cleaned up your roster
Got rid of the hypebeast imposters
Taught hoes how to talk to you proper
'Cause I get good results like a doctor
